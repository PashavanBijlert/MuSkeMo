  abstract = {Objectives: To study vocal effects in singing from the pedagogical method complete vocal technique as related to specific and discrete supraglottic structures and activities by means of laryngostroboscopic imaging and panel testing. Study Design: This is a case-control study with a double-panel assessment. Methods: Twenty singers were recorded performing four of the rough vocal effects from the method Complete Vocal Technique. Two studies were performed: (1) Laryngostroboscopic examination using a videonasoendoscopic camera system and the Laryngostrobe program; (2) two blind-panel assessments with (a) voice clinicians and (b) singing teachers to investigate the recognizability of the vocal effects in supraglottic structures. Results: The four investigated vocal effects could be related to particular and discrete vibratory pattern of supraglottic structures; Distortion as vibrations of the ventricular folds, Growl as vibrations of the arytenoid cartilages against the epiglottis, Rattle as the vibration of the arytenoid cartilages against one another, and Grunt as the vibrations of the whole supraglottic structure from level 1–4 at low frequencies with a large amplitude in the vibration of the vocal folds, with particular movement of the aryepiglottic folds. The two panels recognized the vocal effects with 91\%/96\% accuracy for Distortion, 91\%/74\% accuracy for Rattle, 90\%/66\% accuracy for Grunt, and 83\%/99\% accuracy for Growl, with an overall accuracy of 91\%/84\%. Conclusion: Vocal effects can be performed, identified, and recognized as particular vibratory patterns of supraglottic structures with no visible pathology in subjects performing the effects.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             A framework to study interlimb coordination, which allowed the analysis of all the symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits, was recently proposed. It suggests that gait depends on a common basic pattern controlling the coordination of the forelimbs (fore lag, FL), the coordination of the hindlimbs (hind lag, HL)and the relationship between these two pairs of limbs (pair lag, PL) in an anteroposterior sequence of movement (APS). These three time parameters are sufficient for identifying all steady gaits. We assumed in this work that this same framework could also be used to study non-steady locomotion, particularly the transitions between symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits. Moreover, as the limbs are coordinated in time and also in space during locomotion, we associated three analogous space parameters (fore gap, FG; hind gap, HG and pair gap, PG) to the three time parameters. We studied the interlimb coordination of dogs and cats moving on a runway with a symmetrical gait. In the middle of the runway, the gait was disturbed by an obstacle, and the animal had to change to an asymmetrical coordination to get over it. The time(FL, HL, PL) and space (FG, HG, PG) parameters of each sequence of the trials were calculated. The results demonstrated that the APS method allows quantification of the interlimb coordination during the symmetrical and asymmetrical phases and during the transition between them, in both dogs and cats. The space and time parameters make it possible to link the timing and the spacing of the footfalls, and to quantify the spatiotemporal dimension of gaits in different mammals. The slight differences observed between dogs and cats could reflect their morphological differences. The APS method could thus be used to understand the implication of morphology in interlimb coordination. All these results are consistent with current knowledge in biomechanics and neurobiology, therefore the APS reflects the actual biological functioning of quadrupedal interlimb coordination.},

  abstract = {Birds are so stable that they can rest and even sleep standing up. We propose that stable static balance is achieved by tensegrity. The rigid bones can be held together by tension in the tendons, allowing the system to stabilize under the action of gravity. We used the proportions of the bird's osteomuscular system to create a mathematical model. First, the extensor muscles and tendons of the leg are replaced by a single cable that follows the leg and is guided by joint pulleys. Analysis of the model shows that it can achieve balance. However, it does not match the biomechanical characteristics of the bird's body and is not stable. We then replaced the single cable with four cables, roughly corresponding to the extensor groups, and added a ligament loop at the knee. The model is then able to reach a stable equilibrium and the biomechanical characteristics are satisfied. Some of the anatomical features used in our model correspond to innovations unique to the avian lineage. We propose that tensegrity, which allows light and stable mechanical systems, is fundamental to the evolution of the avian body plan. It can also be used as an alternative model for bipedal robots.},

When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {An understanding of bone apparent and material densities and how they vary within bone at the organ level is of great interest in the understanding of degenerative bone conditions and for biomedical engineering applications. The densities of bone tissue have been shown to appreciably influence the mechanical competency of bone tissue. In order to assess the density of bone in the body, it is important to ensure that the parameters being measured in vivo are truly representative of the real values that have been measured in vitro. To assess the densities of bone across the entire spectrum of available porosities, 112 samples from an elephant femur were assessed using the Archimedes method (water displacement) and by micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). Comparisons were drawn between the two methods to determine if the densities calculated by μ-CT were representative of physically measured densities. The results showed that the apparent densities measured over the entire spectrum were very similar but varied in the intermediate regions of bone tissue, probably due to an increased presence of osteoid, increased remodelling or experimental error as these type of bone is known for the presence of regions of closed cell geometry in the cancellous architecture. It could be argued that the measurements taken by μ-CT are more reliable of bone density values for the mineralised regions of bone as the threshold is defined with respect to the absorption of x-rays by the mineral. By contrast, the Archimedes method thresholds everything with a density value above that of the surrounding medium, 1 (g cm-3) for water, and hence it is more sensitive to the presence of osteoid, soft collagenous matrix and epithelial cell layers. Further research is required to optimise the parameters of scanning methods for the structural properties of different bone tissue porosities, which hopefully in turn will be able to provide a basis for the development of predictive remodelling models.},

  abstract = {The well-developed Achilles tendon in humans is generally interpreted as an adaptation for mechanical energy storage and reuse during cyclic locomotion. All other extant great apes have a short tendon and long-fibred triceps surae, which is thought to be beneficial for locomotion in a complex arboreal habitat as this morphology enables a large range of motion. Surprisingly, highly arboreal gibbons show a more human-like triceps surae with a long Achilles tendon. Evidence for a spring-like function similar to humans is not conclusive. We revisit and integrate our anatomical and biomechanical data to calculate the energy that can be recovered from the recoiling Achilles tendon during ankle plantar flexion in bipedal gibbons. Only 7.5\% of the required external positive work in a stride can come from tendon recoil, yet it is delivered at an instant when the whole-body energy level drops. Consequently, an additional similar amount of mechanical energy must simultaneously dissipate elsewhere in the system. Altogether, this challenges the concept of an energy-saving function in the gibbon's Achilles tendon. Cercopithecids, sister group of the apes, also have a human-like triceps surae. Therefore, a well-developed Achilles tendon, present in the last common ‘Cercopithecoidea–Hominoidea’ ancestor, seems plausible. If so, the gibbon's anatomy represents an evolutionary relict (no harm–no benefit), and the large Achilles tendon is not the premised key adaptation in humans (although the spring-like function may have further improved during evolution). Moreover, the triceps surae anatomy of extant non-human great apes must be a convergence, related to muscle control and range of motion. This perspective accords with the suggestions put forward in the literature that the last common hominoid ancestor was not necessarily great ape-like, but might have been more similar to the small-bodied catarrhines.},

  abstract = {In locomotion that involves repetitive motion of propulsive structures (arms, legs, fins, wings) there are resonant frequencies f* at which the energy consumption is a minimum. As animals need to change their speed, they can maintain this energy minimum by tuning their body resonances. We discuss the physical principles of frequency tuning, and how it relates to forces, damping, and oscillation amplitude. The resonant frequency of pendulum-type oscillators (e.g. swinging arms and legs) may be changed by varying the mass moment of inertia, or the vertical acceleration of the pendulum pivot. The frequency of elastic vibrations (e.g. the bell of a jellyfish) can be tuned with a non-linear modulus of elasticity: soft for low deflection amplitudes (low resonant frequency), and stiff for large displacements (high resonant frequency). Tuning of elastic oscillations can also be achieved by changing the effective length or cross-sectional area of the elastic members, or by allowing springs in parallel or in series to become active. We propose that swimming and flying animals generate oscillating propulsive forces from precisely placed shed vortices and that these tuned motions can only occur when vortex shedding and the simple harmonic motion of the elastic elements of the propulsive structures are in resonance. ?? 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

  abstract = {Humans and other animals can temporarily store mechanical energy in elastic oscillations, fel, of body parts and in pendulum oscillations, fp = const √(g/L), of legs, length L, or other appendages, and thereby reduce the energy consumption of locomotion. However, energy saving only occurs if these oscillations are tuned to the leg propagation frequency f. It has long been known that f is tuned to the pendulum frequency of the free-swinging leg of walkers. During running the leg frequency increases to some new value f = fr. We propose that in order to maintain resonance the animal, mass M, actively increases its leg pendulum frequency to the new value fp, r = const √(ay/L) = fr, by giving its hips a vertical acceleration ay = Fy/M. The pendulum frequency is increased ir the impact force Fy of the stance foot is larger than Mg, explaining the observation by Alexander and Bennet-Clark (1976) that Fv becomes larger than Mg when animals start to run. Our model predictions of the running velocity Ur as function of L, Fv, are in agreement with measurements of these quantities (Farley et al. 1993). The leg’s longitudinal elastic oscillation frequency scales as fel = const √(k/M). Experiments by Ferris et al., (1998) show that runners adjust their leg’s stiffness, k, when running on surfaces of different elasticity so that the total stiffness k remains constant. Our analysis of their data suggests that the longitudinal oscillations of the stance leg are indeed kept in tune with the running frequency. Therefore we conclude that humans, and by extension all animals, maintain resonance during running. Our model also predicts the Froude number of walking-running transitions, Fr = U2/gL ≈ 0.5 in good agreement with measurements. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the present study,we examined Kassina's distinct locomotory mode to determine whether these frogs walk or run and how their gait may change with speed. We used multiple methods to distinguish between terrestrial gaits: the existence or absence of an aerial phase, duty factor, relative footfall patterns and the mechanics of the animal's center of mass (COM). To measure kinematic and kinetic variables, we recorded digital video as the animals moved over a miniature force platform (N=12 individuals). With respect to footfall patterns, the frogs used a single gait and walked at all speeds examined. Duty factor always exceeded 0.59. Based on COM mechanics, however, the frogs used both walking and running gaits. At slower speeds, the fluctuations in the horizontal kinetic energy (Ek) and gravitational potential energy (Ep) of the COM were largely out of phase,indicating a vaulting or walking gait. In most of the trials, Kassinaused a combined gait at intermediate speeds, unlike cursorial animals with distinct gait transitions. This combined gait, much like a mammalian gallop,exhibited the mechanics of both vaulting and bouncing gaits. At faster speeds,the Ek and Ep of Kassina's COM were more in phase, indicating the use of a bouncing or running gait. Depending on the definition used to distinguish between walking and running, Kassina either only used a walking gait at all speeds or used a walking gait at slower speeds but then switched to a running gait as speed increased.},

  abstract = {Aim:               Preoperative identification of acetabular corrections that optimally improve joint stability and reduce elevated contact stresses could further reduce osteoarthritis progression in patients with hip dysplasia who are treated with periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). The purpose of this study was to investigate how providing patient-specific, mechanically optimal acetabular reorientations to the surgeon during preoperative planning affected the surgically achieved correction.                                         Methods:               Preoperative CT scans were used to create patient-specific hip models for 6 patients scheduled for PAO. A simulated acetabular fragment was extracted from the preoperative pelvis model and computationally rotated to simulate candidate acetabular reorientations. For each candidate, discrete element analysis was used to compute contact stresses during walking, which were summed over the gait cycle and scaled by patient age to obtain chronic contact stress-time exposure. The ideal patient-specific reorientation was identified using a cost function that balances minimising chronic stress exposures and achieving surgically acceptable acetabular coverage angles. The optimal reorientation angles and associated contact mechanics were provided to the surgeon preoperatively. After PAO was performed, a model of the surgically achieved correction was created from a postoperative CT scan. Radiographic coverage and contact mechanics were compared between preoperative, optimal, and surgically achieved orientations.                                         Results:                                While surgically achieved reorientations were not significantly different from optimal reorientations in radiographically measured lateral ( p\,=\,0.094) or anterior ( p\,=\,0.063) coverage, surgically achieved reorientations had significantly ( p\,=\,0.031) reduced total contact area compared to optimal reorientations. The difference in lateral coverage and peak chronic exposure between surgically achieved and optimal reorientations decreased with increasing surgeon experience using the models (R²\,=\,0.758, R                 2                 \,=\,0.630, respectively).

  abstract = {The principal bones, muscles and tendons in the legs of seven species of antelope of varying size have been measured, and aliometric equations have been derived. Some data published by Sachs (1967) have also been analysed. Most of the exponents of the aliometric equations agree well with McMahon's (1973, 1975a) theory of elastic similarity: lengths are approximately proportional to (mass)               0˙25               , diameters to (mass)               0˙375               and cross‐sectional areas to (mass)               0˙75               . However, some of the exponents for diameters and areas in the hind leg are significantly different from those predicted by the theory.                          The results are discussed in conjunction with previously published data on fast galloping. It is shown that maximum stresses in bones, muscles and tendons are probably more or less independent of body mass in antelopes galloping at their maximum speed. The tensile stresses in the tibia and humerus approach the tensile yield strength of bone. The total work which is done by the muscles in each stride at maximum speed and the energy saved by elastic storage are probably more or less proportional to body mass. The deviations of some of the allometric exponents for diameter from the expected value of 0middot;375 are partially explained.},

  abstract = {The dynamic similarity hypothesis postulates that different mammals move in a dynamically similar fashion whenever they travel at speeds that give them equal values of a dimensionless parameter, the Froude number. Thus, given information about one species, it could be possible to predict for others relationships between size, speed and features of gait such as stride length, duty factor, the phase relationships of the feet and the patterns of force exerted on the ground. Data for a diverse sample of mammals have been used to test the hypothesis. It is found to be tenable in many cases when comparisons are confined to quadrupedal mammals of the type described by Jenkins (1971) as "cursorial". Most mammals of mass greater than 5 kg are of this type. Although the hypothesis applies less successfully to comparisons between cursorial and non-cursorial mammals it is shown to be a reasonable approximation even for such comparisons and for comparisons between quadrupedal mammals and bipedal mammals and birds.},

Kinetic energy lost by the body, as the forelegs end their backward swing and the hind legs end their forward swing, is stored briefly as elastic strain energy, and recovered in an elastic recoil. Thus energy is saved, making galloping the most economical gait for high speeds. Some strain energy is also stored in muscle fibres and in the vertebral column. Mechanical tests on the aponeurosis and vertebrae lead to estimates of the quantities of energy involved.},

  abstract = {Ten species of ungulate were filmed, galloping in their natural habitat. They ranged in size from Thomson's gazelle (about 20 kg) to giraffe (about 1000 kg). They were pursued to make them run as fast as possible. The films have been analysed to determine speed, stride frequency, stride and step lengths, and duty factors. The dependence of these quantities on body size is discussed.                                         Summary:               Fast locomotion of zebra, giraffe, warthog and seven species of Bovidae has been studied. The animals were filmed from a pursuing vehicle while galloping in their natural habitat.                                Stride frequency was more closely correlated with limb length (represented by hip height) than with body mass. Mean stride frequency was proportional to (hip height)                 ‐0·51                 and maximum stride frequency to (hip height)                 ‐0·63                 .                                               Maximum speed was between 10 and 14 m s                 ‐1                 for all species except buffalo (7 m s                 ‐1                 ). It was not significantly correlated with body mass.                                               Since the small species ran at least as fast as the large ones they attained higher Froude numbers. Relative stride length was approximately 1·8 (Froude number)                 0·39                 for all species, irrespective of size. Relative step length was approximately 0·65 (Froude number)                 0·2                 , both for the fore feet and for the hind ones. The vertical forces exerted by the feet are proportional to (body weight)×(Froude number)                 0·2                 so the forces at maximum speed are larger multiples of body weight for small species than for large ones.},

The positions of dinosaurs' centres of mass, derived from models, show that some large quadrupedal dinosaurs supported most of their weight on their hind legs and were probably capable of rearing up on their hind legs.Distributions of bending moments along the backs of large dinosaurs are derived from measurements on models. The tensions required in epaxial muscles to enable Diplodocus to stand are calculated. It is likely that the long neck of this dinosaur was supported by some structure running through the notches in the neural spines of its cervical and dorsal vertebrae. The nature of this hypothetical structure is discussed.An attempt is made to reconstruct the walking gait of sauropod dinosaurs, from the pattern of footprints in fossil tracks.The dimensions of dinosaur leg bones are compared to predictions for mammals of equal body mass, obtained by extrapolation of allometric equations. Their dimensions are also used to calculate a quantity which is used as an indicator of strength in bending. Comparisons with values for modern animals lead to speculations about the athletic performance of dinosaurs.Estimates of pressures exerted on the ground by the feet of dinosaurs are used in a discussion of the ability of dinosaurs to walk over soft ground.}

  abstract = {Biomechanical modeling shows that archosaur leg muscle leverage evolved gradually, yet with a Jurassic pulse of specialization.           ,              Bipedal locomotion evolved along the archosaurian lineage to birds, shifting from “hip-based” to “knee-based” mechanisms. However, the roles of individual muscles in these changes and their evolutionary timings remain obscure. Using 13 three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of the hindlimbs of bird-line archosaurs, we quantify how the moment arms (i.e., leverages) of 35 locomotor muscles evolved. Our results support two hypotheses: From early theropod dinosaurs to birds, knee flexors’ moment arms decreased relative to knee extensors’, and medial long-axis rotator moment arms for the hip increased (trading off with decreased hip abductor moment arms). Our results reveal how, from the Triassic Period, bipedal theropod dinosaurs gradually modified their hindlimb form and function, shifting more from hip-based to knee-based locomotion and hip-abductor to hip-rotator balancing mechanisms inherited by birds. Yet, we also discover unexpected ancestral specializations in larger Jurassic theropods, lost later in the bird-line, complicating the paradigm of gradual transformation.},

Similar sesamoids have evolved in the knee extensor tendon independently in birds, but it is unknown if these also affect the mechanical advantage of knee extensors. Here, we examine the mechanics of the patellofemoral joint in the helmeted guineafowl               Numida meleagris               using a method based on muscle and tendon moment arms taken about the patella's rotation centre around the distal femur.

Our results support the inference that the patella of               Numida               does alter knee extensor leverage during running, but with a mechanical advantage generally greater than that seen in humans, implying relatively greater extension force but relatively lesser extension velocity.},

But how accurately can these be estimated? Computational modeling was used to estimate the inertial properties including mass, density, and center of mass (COM) for extant crocodiles (adult and juvenile               Crocodylus johnstoni               ) and birds (               Gallus gallus               ; junglefowl and broiler chickens), to identify the chief sources of variation and methodological errors, and their significance. High‐resolution computed tomography scans were segmented into 3D objects and imported into inertial property estimation software that allowed for the examination of variable body segment densities (e.g., air spaces such as lungs, and deformable body outlines). Considerable biological variation of inertial properties was found within groups due to ontogenetic changes as well as evolutionary changes between chicken groups. COM positions shift in variable directions during ontogeny in different groups. Our method was repeatable and the resolution was sufficient for accurate estimations of mass and density in particular. However, we also found considerable potential methodological errors for COM related to (1) assumed body segment orientation, (2) what frames of reference are used to normalize COM for size‐independent comparisons among animals, and (3) assumptions about tail shape. Methods and assumptions are suggested to minimize these errors in the future and thereby improve estimation of inertial properties for extant and extinct animals. In the best cases, 10\%–15\% errors in these estimates are unavoidable, but particularly for extinct taxa errors closer to 50\% should be expected, and therefore, cautiously investigated. Nonetheless in the best cases these methods allow rigorous estimation of inertial properties. Anat Rec, 292:1442–1461, 2009. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Pronograde trunk orientation in small birds causes prominent intra-limb asymmetries in the leg function. As yet, it is not clear whether these asymmetries induced by the trunk reflect general constraints on the leg function regardless of the specific leg architecture or size of the species. To address this, we instruct twelve participants to walk at a self-selected velocity with four postures: regular erect, with 30°, 50° and maximal trunk flexion. In addition, we simulate the axial leg force (along the line connecting hip and centre of pressure) using two simple models: spring and damper in series, and parallel spring and damper. As trunk flexion increases, lower limb joints become more flexed during stance. Similar to birds, the associated posterior shift of the hip relative to the centre of mass leads to a shorter leg at toe-off than at touchdown, and to a flatter angle of attack and a steeper leg angle at toe-off. Furthermore, walking with maximal trunk flexion induces right-skewed vertical and horizontal ground reaction force profiles comparable to those in birds. Interestingly, the spring and damper in series model provides a superior prediction of the axial leg force across trunk‑flexed gaits compared to the parallel spring and damper model; in regular erect gait, the damper does not substantially improve the reproduction of the human axial leg force. In conclusion, mimicking birds' pronograde locomotion by bending the trunk forward causes a human leg function similar to that of birds despite the different morphology of the segmented legs.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

  abstract = {Summary             Increasing insight into neuro-mechanical control strategies during perturbed locomotion is gained. In contrast, more general analyses on simple model (template) related parameters during avian terrestrial locomotion are still rare. Quails kinematic data obtained using X-ray videography combined with ground reaction force measurements were used as a basis to investigate how "global" template and "local" leg joint parameters in this small predominantly terrestrial bird change with speed and gait. Globally, quail locomotion approximates a spring-like behavior in all investigated gaits. However, ground reaction forces are more vertically oriented which may help to balance the trunk. At the joint level, practically all the spring like work was found to occur in the ITJ (intertarsal joint). From walking to grounded running the local stiffness of the ITJ decreases similarly to the reduction observed in global leg stiffness. Thus, in gaits without aerial phases the quails may modulate ITJ stiffness to regulate global leg stiffness, and therefore gait changes, to a significant degree. At higher speeds leg compression and leg stiffness are increased (the latter to values not significantly different to those obtained during walking). This enables the animals to shorten contact time and to generate aerial phases (running). However, we did not observe a change in the stiffness in the ITJ with a change of gait from grounded running to running. We hypothesize that a more extended leg at touch-down, controlled by the joint angles in knee and ITJ, has an important influence in the leg stiffness adjustment process during running.},

Male Wistar rats were treated with cyclosporin-A or rapamycin for 10 days. To promote muscle stretching, casts were positioned so as completely to dorsiflex the plantar-flexor muscles at the ankle in one hind limb during the last 4 days of treatment with either cyclosporin-A or rapamycin. Thereafter, we determined soleus length, weight, protein content, and phenotype. In addition, NFATc1, Raptor, S6K1, 4E-BP1, iNOS, and nNOS gene expression in the soleus were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Soleus length, weight, and protein content were significantly reduced by rapamycin treatment in animals submitted to stretching (P{$<$}0.05). In contrast, cyclosporin-A treatment did not alter these parameters. In all cyclosporin-A treated groups, there was a significant reduction in NFATc1 expression (P{$<$}0.001). Similarly, a significant reduction was noted in Raptor (P{$<$}0.001) and S6K1 (P{$<$}0.01) expression in all rapamycin-treated groups. No alteration was observed in 4E-BP1 gene expression among rapamycin-treated groups. Stretching increased gene expression of both NOS isoforms in skeletal muscle. Rapamycin treatment did not interfere with NOS gene expression (P{$<$}0.05). Cyclosporin-A treatment did not impair muscle growth induced by stretching but instead caused a marked slow-to-fast fiber shift in the soleus; this was attenuated by stretching. The data presented herein indicate that mTOR pathway is involved in skeletal muscle longitudinal growth.},

Computational modeling of animal movement can help to better understand the emergence of locomotive patterns and their body dynamics. Although considerable progress has been made in this subject in recent years, the strengths and limitations of kinematic simulations at the scale of small moving animals are not well understood. In response to this, this work evaluated the effects of modeling uncertainties on kinematic simulations at small scale. In order to do so, a multibody model of a               Messor barbarus               ant was developed. The model was built from 3D scans coming from X-ray micro-computed tomography. Joint geometrical parameters were estimated from the articular surfaces of the exoskeleton. Kinematic data of a free walking ant was acquired using high-speed synchronized video cameras. Spatial coordinates of 49 virtual markers were used to run inverse kinematics simulations using the OpenSim software. The sensitivity of the model’s predictions to joint geometrical parameters and marker position uncertainties was evaluated by means of two Monte Carlo simulations. The developed model was four times more sensitive to perturbations on marker position than those of the joint geometrical parameters. These results are of interest for locomotion studies of small quadrupeds, octopods, and other multi-legged animals.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The effects of length trajectory on the mechanical power output of mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were investigated using the work loop technique in vitro at 37 °C. Muscles were subjected to sinusoidal and sawtooth cycles of lengthening and shortening; for the sawtooth cycles, the proportion of the cycle spent shortening was varied. For each cycle frequency examined, the timing and duration of stimulation and the strain amplitude were optimized to yield the maximum power output. During sawtooth length trajectories, power increased as the proportion of the cycle spent shortening increased. The increase in power was attributable to more complete activation of the muscle due to the longer stimulation duration, to a more rapid rise in force resulting from increased stretch velocity and to an increase in the optimal strain amplitude. The power produced during symmetrical sawtooth cycles was 5–10 \% higher than during sinusoidal work loops. Maximum power outputs of 92W kg−1 (soleus) and 247 W kg−1 (EDL) were obtained by manipulating the length trajectory. For each muscle, this was approximately 70 \% of the maximum power output estimated from the isotonic force–velocity relationship.             We have found a number of examples suggesting that animals exploit prolonging the shortening phase during activities requiring a high power output, such as flying, jet-propulsion swimming and vocalization. In an evolutionary context, increasing the relative shortening duration provides an alternative to increasing the maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) as a way to increase power output.},

Aberrant responses to forces, or changes in the nature of such forces, are implicated in a variety of diseases. Cells contain several types of adhesions, linking them to their external environment. It is through these adhesions that forces are both sensed (from the outside inwards) and applied (from inside to out). Furthermore, several adhesion-based proteins are sensitive to changes in intracellular forces, utilising them for activation and regulation. Here, we outline how vinculin, a key component of integrin-mediated adhesions linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM), is regulated by force and acts as force transducing protein. We discuss the role of vinculin in vivo and its place in health and disease; summarise the proposed mechanisms by which vinculin is recruited to and activated at integrin-ECM adhesions; and discuss recent findings that place vinculin as the major force sensing and transmitting component of cell-matrix adhesion complexes. Finally, we discuss the role of vinculin in regulating the cellular responses to both the physical properties of the external environment and to externally applied physical stimuli.},

  abstract = {Muscle fiber architecture, i.e., the physical arrangement of fibers within a muscle, is an important determinant of a muscle's mechanical function. In pennate muscles, fibers are oriented at an angle to the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). The magnitude of fiber rotation, and therefore gear ratio, depends on how the muscle changes shape in the dimensions orthogonal to the muscle's line of action. Here, we show that gear ratio is not fixed for a given muscle but decreases significantly with the force of contraction (               P               {$<$} 0.0001). We find that dynamic muscle-shape changes promote fiber rotation at low forces and resist fiber rotation at high forces. As a result, gearing varies automatically with the load, to favor velocity output during low-load contractions and force output for contractions against high loads. Therefore, muscle-shape changes act as an automatic transmission system allowing a pennate muscle to shift from a high gear during rapid contractions to low gear during forceful contractions. These results suggest that variable gearing in pennate muscles provides a mechanism to modulate muscle performance during mechanically diverse functions.},

The trot of 24 two‐year‐old Dutch Warmblood horses was recorded at 4 m/s on a high‐speed treadmill using kinematic analysis equipment. Joint angle‐time, angle‐angle, stick and marker diagrams were used to present graphically the data following standardised procedures. As the kinematic data were expressed with reference to the joint angles of the horse standing squarely and were time‐standardised to the duration of the stride cycle, mean joint curves for the total group could be calculated and therefore describe the function of the different segments of the equine hind limb. The motion of the hind limb in the sagittal plane appeared to be pendular around a rotation point in the acetabulum. During the stance phase the extension of the fetlock joint and stance flexion of the stifle, tarsal and coffin joints illustrate the shock absorption of the hind limb. In the swing phase the reciprocal apparatus, which forms the coupling mechanism between stifle and tarsal joint, also influences the fetlock joint because synchronous flexion and extension between these 3 joints were demonstrated. By graphically presenting hind limb motion we were able to illustrate the relation between kinematics and function. This graphic analysis can be used in clinical studies involving quantification of equine hind limb coordination in the sagittal plane.},

  abstract = {Summary             The kinematics of 24 two‐year‐old Dutch Warmblood horses were recorded at the trot (4 m/s) on a high‐speed treadmill to study the coordination of joints within the equine forelimb. Joint angle‐time, angle‐angle, stick, and marker diagrams were used to show forelimb motion graphically. Because the kinematic data referred to the joint angles of the horse standing squarely and were time‐standardised to the duration of the stride cycle, mean joint curves could be calculated for the total group. The motion of each segment in the equine forelimb during a complete stride is described and its function in intralimb coordination evaluated. It appeared that the rotation of the scapula and the cranio‐caudal movement of the distal forelimb are synchronous and pendular. The carpal joint rapidly snaps into overextension at the beginning of the stance phase to enable the forelimb to work as a propulsive strut. The fetlock joint acts as an elastic spring, thereby conserving energy and, at the same time, absorbs oscillations generated by initial ground contact. Furthermore, the coordination between carpal and fetlock joints in the swing phase appears to be strongly influenced by inertia. Using the graphic tools evaluated in this paper, we were able to visualise the kinematics of the equine forelimb and relate these to specific functions of the forelimb in locomotion. This information can be used to select kinematic variables for clinical studies in which equine forelimb function has to be described and quantified.},

  abstract = {Designers of legged robots are challenged with creating mechanisms that allow energy-efficient locomotion with robust and minimalistic control. Sources of high energy costs in legged robots include the rapid loading and high forces required to support the robot’s mass during stance and the rapid cycling of the leg’s state between stance and swing phases. Here, we demonstrate an avian-inspired robot leg design, BirdBot, that challenges the reliance on rapid feedback control for joint coordination and replaces active control with intrinsic, mechanical coupling, reminiscent of a self-engaging and disengaging clutch. A spring tendon network rapidly switches the leg’s slack segments into a loadable state at touchdown, distributes load among joints, enables rapid disengagement at toe-off through elastically stored energy, and coordinates swing leg flexion. A bistable joint mediates the spring tendon network’s disengagement at the end of stance, powered by stance phase leg angle progression. We show reduced knee-flexing torque to a 10th of what is required for a nonclutching, parallel-elastic leg design with the same kinematics, whereas spring-based compliance extends the leg in stance phase. These mechanisms enable bipedal locomotion with four robot actuators under feedforward control, with high energy efficiency. The robot offers a physical model demonstration of an avian-inspired, multiarticular elastic coupling mechanism that can achieve self-stable, robust, and economic legged locomotion with simple control and no sensory feedback. The proposed design is scalable, allowing the design of large legged robots. BirdBot demonstrates a mechanism for self-engaging and disengaging parallel elastic legs that are contact-triggered by the foot’s own lever-arm action.           ,              A multiarticular elastic coupling-decoupling mechanism enables self-stable, robust legged locomotion without sensory feedback.},

An underexplored but potentially explanatory feature is the ability of birds to actively change wing shape to meet aerodynamic and behavioral demands. Across 61 species, we found strong associations with flight behavior and mass for range of motion traits but not wing shape and strikingly different associations for different aspects of motion capability. Further, static morphology exhibits high phylogenetic signal, whereas range of motion shows greater evolutionary lability. These results suggest a new framework for understanding the evolution of avian flight: Rather than wing morphology, it is range of motion, an emergent property of morphology, that is predominantly reshaped as flight strategy and body size evolve.},

The mean force-velocity curves of children and adults revealed obvious differences between the groups. The curves remained different following corrections of torque for CSA and velocity for length. ANOVA revealed significant differences in the uncorrected values of power between the two groups. When power values were corrected for lean thigh muscle volume, no significant differences were found between the groups. These findings suggest that differences in muscle strength between children and adults are a function of muscle size and imply that muscle function remains relatively unchanged from childhood to early adulthood.},

  abstract = {The study of animal locomotion can be logistically challenging, especially in the case of large or unhandleable animals in uncontrolled environments. Here we demonstrate the utility of a low cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in measuring two-dimensional running kinematics from free-roaming giraffes (               Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa               ) in the Free State Province, South Africa. We collected 120 Hz video of running giraffes, and calibrated each video frame using metatarsal length as a constant object of scale. We tested a number of methods to measure metatarsal length. The method with the least variation used close range photography and a trigonometric equation to spatially calibrate the still image, and derive metatarsal length. In the absence of this option, a spatially calibrated surface model of the study terrain was used to estimate topographical dimensions in video footage of interest. Data for the terrain models were collected using the same equipment, during the same study period. We subsequently validated the accuracy of the UAV method by comparing similar speed measurements of a human subject running on a treadmill, with treadmill speed. At 8 m focal distance we observed an error of 8\% between the two measures of speed. This error was greater at a shorter focal distance, and when the subject was not in the central field of view. We recommend that future users maximise the camera focal distance, and keep the subject in the central field of view. The studied giraffes used a grounded rotary gallop with a speed range of 3.4–6.9 ms               −1               (never cantering, trotting or pacing), and lower duty factors when compared with other cursorial quadrupeds. As this pattern might result in adverse increases in peak vertical limb forces with speed, it was notable to find that contralateral limbs became more in-phase with speed. Considering the latter pattern and the modest maximal speed of giraffes, we speculate that tissue safety factors are maintained within tolerable bounds this way. Furthermore, the angular kinematics of the neck were frequently isolated from the pitching of the body during running; this may be a result of the large mass of the head and neck. Further field experiments and biomechanical models are needed to robustly test these speculations.},

Herein, we provide the first evaluation of the accuracy of these muscle area assessment (MAA) techniques for estimating muscle proportions, force outputs and bone loading in a comparative macroevolutionary context using the rodent masticatory system as a case study. We find that MAA approaches perform poorly, yielding large absolute errors in muscle properties, bite force and particularly bone stress. Perhaps more fundamentally, these methods regularly fail to correctly capture many qualitative differences between rodent morphotypes, particularly in stress patterns in finite-element models. Our findings cast doubts on the validity of these approaches as means to provide input data for biomechanical models applied to understand functional transitions in the fossil record, and perhaps even in taxon-rich statistical models that examine broad-scale macroevolutionary patterns. We suggest that future work should go back to the bones to test if correlations between attachment area and muscle size within homologous muscles across a large number of species yield strong predictive relationships that could be used to deliver more accurate predictions for macroevolutionary and functional studies.},

  abstract = {We investigate whether musculoskeletal anatomy and three-dimensional (3-D) body proportions were modified during the evolution of large (.6000 kg) body size in Allosauroidea (Dinosauria: Theropoda). Three adaptations for maintaining locomotor performance at large body size, related to muscle leverage, mass, and body proportions, are tested and all are unsupported in this analysis. Predictions from 3-D musculoskeletal models of medium-sized (Allosaurus) and large-bodied (Acrocanthosaurus) allosauroids suggest that muscle leverage scaled close to isometry, well below the positive allometry required to compensate for declining muscle cross-sectional area with increasing body size. Regression analyses on a larger allosauroid data set finds slight positive allometry in the moment arms of major hip extensors, but isometry is included within confidence limits. Contrary to other recent studies of large-bodied theropod clades, we found no compelling evidence for significant positive allometry in muscle mass between exemplar medium- and large-bodied allosauroids. Indeed, despite the uncertainty in quantitative soft tissue reconstruction, we find strong evidence for negative allometry in the caudofemoralis longus muscle, the single largest hip extensor in non-avian theropods. Finally, we found significant inter-study variability in center-of-mass predictions for allosauroids, but overall observe that consistently proportioned soft tissue reconstructions produced similar predictions across the group, providing no support for a caudal shift in the center of mass in larger taxa that might otherwise reduce demands on hip extensor muscles during stance. Our data set provides further quantitative support to studies that argue for a significant decline in locomotor performance with increasing body size in non-avian theropods. However, although key pelvic limb synapomorphies of derived allosauroids (e.g., dorsomedially inclined femoral head) evolved at intermediate body sizes, they may nonetheless have improved mass support.},

  abstract = {Body mass reconstructions of extinct vertebrates are most robust when complete to near-complete skeletons allow the reconstruction of either physical or digital models. Digital models are most efficient in terms of time and cost, and provide the facility to infinitely modify model properties non-destructively, such that sensitivity analyses can be conducted to quantify the effect of the many unknown parameters involved in reconstructions of extinct animals. In this study we use laser scanning (LiDAR) and computer modelling methods to create a range of 3D mass models of five specimens of non-avian dinosaur; two near-complete specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex, the most complete specimens of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis and Strutiomimum sedens, and a near-complete skeleton of a sub-adult Edmontosaurus annectens. LiDAR scanning allows a full mounted skeleton to be imaged resulting in a detailed 3D model in which each bone retains its spatial position and articulation. This provides a high resolution skeletal framework around which the body cavity and internal organs such as lungs and air sacs can be reconstructed. This has allowed calculation of body segment masses, centres of mass and moments or inertia for each animal. However, any soft tissue reconstruction of an extinct taxon inevitably represents a best estimate model with an unknown level of accuracy. We have therefore conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis in which the volumes of body segments and respiratory organs were varied in an attempt to constrain the likely maximum plausible range of mass parameters for each animal. Our results provide wide ranges in actual mass and inertial values, emphasizing the high level of uncertainty inevitable in such reconstructions. However, our sensitivity analysis consistently places the centre of mass well below and in front of hip joint in each animal, regardless of the chosen combination of body and respiratory structure volumes. These results emphasize that future biomechanical assessments of extinct taxa should be preceded by a detailed investigation of the plausible range of mass properties, in which sensitivity analyses are used to identify a suite of possible values to be tested as inputs in analytical models.},

  abstract = {Bite mechanics and feeding behaviour in               Tyrannosaurus rex               are controversial. Some contend that a modest bite mechanically limited               T. rex               to scavenging, while others argue that high bite forces facilitated a predatory mode of life. We use dynamic musculoskeletal models to simulate maximal biting in               T. rex               . Models predict that adult               T. rex               generated sustained bite forces of 35 000–57 000 N at a single posterior tooth, by far the highest bite forces estimated for any terrestrial animal. Scaling analyses suggest that adult               T. rex               had a strong bite for its body size, and that bite performance increased allometrically during ontogeny. Positive allometry in bite performance during growth may have facilitated an ontogenetic change in feeding behaviour in               T. rex               , associated with an expansion of prey range in adults to include the largest contemporaneous animals.},

  abstract = {Fossil evidence for longitudinal arches in the foot is frequently used to constrain the origins of terrestrial bipedality in human ancestors. This approach rests on the prevailing concept that human feet are unique in functioning with a relatively stiff lateral mid-foot, lacking the significant flexion and high plantar pressures present in non-human apes. This paradigm has stood for more than 70 years but has yet to be tested objectively with quantitative data. Herein, we show that plantar pressure records with elevated lateral mid-foot pressures occur frequently in healthy, habitually shod humans, with magnitudes in some individuals approaching absolute maxima across the foot. Furthermore, the same astonishing pressure range is present in bonobos and the orangutan (the most arboreal great ape), yielding overlap with human pressures. Thus, while the mean tendency of habitual mechanics of the mid-foot in healthy humans is indeed consistent with the traditional concept of the lateral mid-foot as a relatively rigid or stabilized structure, it is clear that lateral arch stabilization in humans is not obligate and is often transient. These findings suggest a level of detachment between foot stiffness during gait and osteological structure, hence fossilized bone morphology by itself may only provide a crude indication of mid-foot function in extinct hominins. Evidence for thick plantar tissues in               Ardipithecus ramidus               suggests that a human-like combination of active and passive modulation of foot compliance by soft tissues extends back into an arboreal context, supporting an arboreal origin of hominin bipedalism in compressive orthogrady. We propose that the musculoskeletal conformation of the modern human mid-foot evolved under selection for a functionally tuneable, rather than obligatory stiff structure.},

New data on the mechanical properties of avian tendons showed a mean linear elastic modulus of about 1.3 GPa and failure stress of 74MPa. Physiological cross‐sectional areas were calculated for 12 muscles in each species, together with the cross‐sectional areas of their attached tendons. Investigation into potential various sources of error demonstrate this is a robust method for studying muscle‐tendon units. The mode for calculated peak tendon stresses was 17.5 MPa. The results were compared to those obtained from mammal limbs by Ker, Alexander \& Bennett (1988). It appears that the muscle‐tendon units in birds are not as strongly optimized for the minimization of mass as those in the limbs of mammals. This may reflect a compromise between optimization for minimum mass and other functional requirements.},

Anuran muscle can develop maximal force at lower temperatures than mammalian muscle. Tetanic tension is maximal at normally experienced body temperatures in a variety of animals, but twitch tension seldom is. Thermal dependence of twitch tension varies with muscle fiber type: tension decreases with increasing temperature in fast-twitch muscles and remains constant in slow-twitch muscles. In contrast to the low temperature dependence of force generation, rates of development of tension (time to peak twitch tension and tetanic rise time) and maximal velocity of shortening and power output are markedly temperature dependent, with average temperature coefficient (Q10) values of 2.0-2.5 Q10 values for rate processes of anuran muscle are only slightly lower than those of mammalian muscle. High body temperatures permit rapid rates of muscle contraction; animals active at low body temperatures do not achieve the maximal rate performance their muscles are capable of delivering. Thermal acclimation or hibernation does not appear to result in compensatory adjustments in either force generation or rate processes. In vivo, dynamic processes dependent on contractile rates are positively temperature dependent, although with markedly lower Q10 values than those of isolated muscle. Static force application in vivo is nearly temperature independent.},

  abstract = {Pneumatic (air-filled) postcranial bones are unique to birds among extant tetrapods. Unambiguous skeletal correlates of postcranial pneumaticity first appeared in the Late Triassic (approximately 210 million years ago), when they evolved independently in several groups of bird-line archosaurs (ornithodirans). These include the theropod dinosaurs (of which birds are extant representatives), the pterosaurs, and sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Postulated functions of skeletal pneumatisation include weight reduction in large-bodied or flying taxa, and density reduction resulting in energetic savings during foraging and locomotion. However, the influence of these hypotheses on the early evolution of pneumaticity has not been studied in detail previously. We review recent work on the significance of pneumaticity for understanding the biology of extinct ornithodirans, and present detailed new data on the proportion of the skeleton that was pneumatised in 131 non-avian theropods and Archaeopteryx. This includes all taxa known from significant postcranial remains. Pneumaticity of the cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae occurred early in theropod evolution. This 'common pattern' was conserved on the line leading to birds, and is likely present in Archaeopteryx. Increases in skeletal pneumaticity occurred independently in as many as 12 lineages, highlighting a remarkably high number of parallel acquisitions of a bird-like feature among non-avian theropods. Using a quantitative comparative framework, we show that evolutionary increases in skeletal pneumaticity are significantly concentrated in lineages with large body size, suggesting that mass reduction in response to gravitational constraints at large body sizes influenced the early evolution of pneumaticity. However, the body size threshold for extensive pneumatisation is lower in theropod lineages more closely related to birds (maniraptorans). Thus, relaxation of the relationship between body size and pneumatisation preceded the origin of birds and cannot be explained as an adaptation for flight. We hypothesise that skeletal density modulation in small, non-volant, maniraptorans resulted in energetic savings as part of a multi-system response to increased metabolic demands. Acquisition of extensive postcranial pneumaticity in small-bodied maniraptorans may indicate avian-like high-performance endothermy.},

  abstract = {Mammals use two distinct gallops referred to as the transverse (where landing and take-off are contralateral) and rotary (where landing and take-off are ipsilateral). These two gallops are used by a variety of mammals, but the transverse gallop is epitomized by the horse and the rotary gallop by the cheetah. In this paper, we argue that the fundamental difference between these gaits is determined by which set of limbs, fore or hind, initiates the transition of the centre of mass from a downward–forward to upward–forward trajectory that occurs between the main ballistic (non-contact) portions of the stride when the animal makes contact with the ground. The impulse-mediated directional transition is a key feature of locomotion on limbs and is one of the major sources of momentum and kinetic energy loss, and a main reason why active work must be added to maintain speed in locomotion. Our analysis shows that the equine gallop transition is initiated by a hindlimb contact and occurs in a manner in some ways analogous to the skipping of a stone on a water surface. By contrast, the cheetah gallop transition is initiated by a forelimb contact, and the mechanics appear to have much in common with the human bipedal run. Many mammals use both types of gallop, and the transition strategies that we describe form points on a continuum linked even to functionally symmetrical running gaits such as the tölt and amble.},

Testing over a range of speeds generates a speed-frequency (v-f) relationship. This relationship is commonly posited as a basic feature of human gait. It is often further posited that this curve follows from minimum energy cost strategy. We observed that individuals walking under different constraint circumstances - walking to a range of fixed metronome frequencies (fixed f) or over a range of spaced markers (fixed d) - produce speed-frequency relations distinct from the constrained v relation. We show here that three distinct speed-frequency curves, similar to those observed, are predicted by the assumption that a walking person optimizes an underlying objective function F(v,f) that has a minimum at the preferred gait. Further, the metabolic cost of transport is a reasonable approximate candidate for the function F. © 2001 Academic Press.}

  abstract = {A phenomenological model for muscle energy consumption was developed and used in conjunction with a simple Hill-type model for muscle contraction. The model was used to address two questions. First, can an empirical model of muscle energetics accurately represent the total energetic behavior of frog muscle in isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic contractions? And second, how does such a model perform in a large-scale, multiple-muscle model of human walking? Four simulations were conducted with frog sartorius muscle under full excitation: an isometric contraction, a set of isotonic contractions with the muscle shortening a constant distance under various applied loads, a set of isotonic contractions with the muscle shortening over various distances under a constant load, and an isokinetic contraction in lengthening. The model calculations were evaluated against results of similar thermal in vitro experiments performed on frog sartorius muscle. The energetics model was then incorporated into a large-scale, multiple-muscle model of the human body for the purpose of predicting energy consumption during normal walking. The total energy estimated by the model accurately reflected the observed experimental behavior of frog muscle for an isometric contraction. The model also accurately reproduced the experimental behavior of frog muscle heat production under isotonic shortening and isokinetic lengthening conditions. The estimated rate of metabolic energy consumption for walking was 29\% higher than the value typically obtained from gait measurements.},

  abstract = {Walking balance is central to independent mobility, and falls due to loss of balance are a leading cause of death for people 65 years of age and older. Bipedal gait is typically unstable, but healthy humans use corrective torques to counteract perturbations and stabilize gait. Exoskeleton assistance could benefit people with neuromuscular deficits by providing stabilizing torques at lower-limb joints to replace lost muscle strength and sensorimotor control. However, it is unclear how applied exoskeleton torques translate to changes in walking kinematics. This study used musculoskeletal simulation to investigate how exoskeleton torques applied to the ankle and subtalar joints alter center of mass kinematics during walking. We first created muscle-driven walking simulations using OpenSim Moco by tracking experimental kinematics and ground reaction forces recorded from five healthy adults. We then used forward integration to simulate the effect of exoskeleton torques applied to the ankle and subtalar joints while keeping muscle excitations fixed based on our previous tracking simulation results. Exoskeleton torque lasted for 15\% of the gait cycle and was applied between foot-flat and toe-off during the stance phase, and changes in center of mass kinematics were recorded when the torque application ended. We found that changes in center of mass kinematics were dependent on both the type and timing of exoskeleton torques. Plantarflexion torques produced upward and backward changes in velocity of the center of mass in mid-stance and upward and smaller forward velocity changes near toe-off. Eversion and inversion torques primarily produced lateral and medial changes in velocity in mid-stance, respectively. Intrinsic muscle properties reduced kinematic changes from exoskeleton torques. Our results provide mappings between ankle plantarflexion and inversion-eversion torques and changes in center of mass kinematics which can inform designers building exoskeletons aimed at stabilizing balance during walking. Our simulations and software are freely available and allow researchers to explore the effects of applied torques on balance and gait.},

  abstract = {Principal strains were recorded in vivo from the radial and tibial midshafts of three goats as they increased speed and changed gait. These data were compared with strain data measured for the radius and tibia of the dog (Rubin \& Lanyon, 1982) and the horse (Biewener, Thomason \& Lanyon, 19836) in order to test the hypothesis that similar peak bone strains (stresses) occur at functionally equivalent points in the gaits of different species. Multiple recordings of in vivo strain along the caudal diaphyses of the radius and tibia of one goat were made to test the validity of this technique for measuring peak locomotor stress. Measured strains were extremely consistent over the animal's full range of speed (coefficient of variation for the radius 0-05-0-08, and for the tibia 0-06-0-11). The data from the three gauges, which were spaced 15 mm apart, demonstrated that maximal strains act at the midshaft, substantiating the use of this technique to measure peak locomotor bone strains. Strain levels recorded at the trot-gallop transition and top galloping speeds of the goat were similar to the values reported for the dog and horse, despite large differences in absolute speed (goat, 4-3ms\textasciitilde 1; dog, 6-9ms\textasciitilde '; horse, 7'5ms"' at maximum gallop). The second moments of area of the tibia and radius (+ ulna) of the dog are 29 \% and 113 \% greater than for goats of equal size, explaining how similar strains are achieved in the dog at higher speeds than the goat. Furthermore, peak bone strains recorded at the fastest trotting speed were similar to those recorded at the fastest galloping speed for each species. Peak strains recorded for the goat at a maximum gallop correspond to stresses of +37-9 MPa (cranial) and — 47-7 MPa (caudal) in the radius and +36-3 MPa (cranial) and —50-3 MPa (caudal) in the tibia, representing a safety factor to yield failure of three.},

To determine if the bones of larger animals are stronger than those of small animals, the bending strength of whole bone specimens from the limbs of small mammals and bipedal birds was measured and compared with published data for large mammalian cortical bone (horses and bovids). No significant difference (P \&gt; 0·2) was found in the failure stress of bone over a range in size from 0·05–700 kg (233 ± 53 MN/m1 for small animals compared to 200 ± 28 MN/m2 for large animals). This finding suggests that either the limb bones of small animals are much stronger than they need to be, or that other aspects of locomotion (e.g. duty factor and limb orientation relative to the direction of the ground force) act to decrease peak locomotory stresses in larger animals.},

  abstract = {The scaling of bone and muscle geometry in mammals suggests that peak stresses (ratio of force to cross-sectional area) acting in these two support elements increase with increasing body size. Observations of stresses acting in the limb bones of different sized mammals during strenuous activity, however, indicate that peak bone stress is independent of size (maintaining a safety factor of between 2 and 4). It appears that similar peak bone stresses and muscle stresses in large and small mammals are achieved primarily by a size-dependent change in locomotor limb posture: small animals run with crouched postures, whereas larger species run more upright. By adopting an upright posture, large animals align their limbs more closely with the ground reaction force, substantially reducing the forces that their muscles must exert (proportional to body mass               0.74               ) and hence, the forces that their bones must resist, to counteract joint moments. This change in limb posture to maintain locomotor stresses within safe limits, however, likely limits the maneuverability and accelerative capability of large animals.},

  abstract = {The non-linear viscoelasticity of tendons and ligaments, for which much of their mechanical behavior reflects the properties of their collagen I fibrils, is well suited to absorbing and returning energy associated with the transmission of tensile forces across joints of the body. The high resilience of tendon means that it can serve as an effective biological spring. At the same time, the flexibility of tendons and ligaments allows them to accommodate a wide range of joint movement (or, in the case of ligaments, to restrict movement within a certain range). The high strength of tendons and ligaments also provides considerable weight savings, but this is traded off against the ability to control position and movements of the musculoskeletal system. Tendon and ligament compliance allows elastic energy to be stored and returned to offset energy fluctuations of the bodys center of mass during locomotion, conserving muscle work and reducing the metabolic energy cost of locomotor movement. Tendon architecture greatly affects the storage and recovery of elastic strain energy, with long, thin tendons favoring greater strain energy/volume (and weight) of the tendon. It is likely that other elastic elements, such as muscle aponeuroses, also contribute significant energy savings. Tendon compliance may also reduce the cost of muscle contraction, by reducing a muscles contractile velocity and length change for a given movement, as well as increasing the power output of muscletendon units that is key to rapid acceleration and jumping performance. This power enhancement requires a temporal decoupling of muscle work to stretch the tendon from the subsequent more rapid release of elastic strain energy from the tendon. This decoupling may be achieved by changes in inertia and mechanical advantage in vertebrates, but is facilitated by catch mechanisms in invertebrate jumpers. Although it is critical that tendons and ligaments have sufficient strength and an adequate safety factor to limit the risk of failure, tendons are likely subject to damage during their use, which favors a greater safety factor. In addition, because tendon compliance impedes position control, the thickness of many tendons suggests that having sufficient stiffness, rather than strength, is a key structural requirement. Indeed, the majority of tendons that have been studied to date appear to operate at lower stresses and strains, have larger safety factors, and are stiffer, compared with high-stress tendons of animals specialized for elastic energy savings.},

This possibility must be weighed carefully against the use of non-invasive approaches, such as those based on ground reaction force recordings in relation to limb kinematics (see Chapter 3).

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Moderate to large macropodids can increase their speed while hopping with little or no increase in energy expenditure. This has been interpreted by some workers as resulting from elastic energy savings in their hindlimb tendons. For this to occur, the muscle fibers must transmit force to their tendons with little or no length change. To test whether this is the case, we made in vivo measurements of muscle fiber length change and tendon force in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies Macropus eugenii as they hopped at different speeds on a treadmill. Muscle fiber length changes were less than ±0.5 mm in the plantaris and ±2.2 mm in the lateral gastrocnemius, representing less than 2 \% of total fiber length in the plantaris and less than 6 \% in the lateral gastrocnemius, with respect to resting length. The length changes of the plantaris fibers suggest that this occurred by means of elastic extension of attached cross-bridges. Much of the length change in the lateral gastrocnemius fibers occurred at low force early in the stance phase, with generally isometric behavior at higher forces. Fiber length changes did not vary significantly with increased hopping speed in either muscle (P\&gt;0.05), despite a 1.6-fold increase in muscle–tendon force between speeds of 2.5 and 6.0 m s−1. Length changes of the PL fibers were only 7±4 \% and of the LG fibers 34±12 \% (mean ± S.D., N=170) of the stretch calculated for their tendons, resulting in little net work by either muscle (plantaris 0.01±0.03 J; gastrocnemius −0.04±0.30 J; mean ± S.D.). In contrast, elastic strain energy stored in the tendons increased with increasing speed and averaged 20-fold greater than the shortening work performed by the two muscles. These results show that an increasing amount of strain energy stored within the hindlimb tendons is usefully recovered at faster steady hopping speeds, without being dissipated by increased stretch of the muscles’ fibers. This finding supports the view that tendon elastic saving of energy is an important mechanism by which this species is able to hop at faster speeds with little or no increase in metabolic energy expenditure.},

Ground reaction force (GRF) patterns of these specialised gaits have not been reported; therefore, appraisal of these gaits using nongaited horse kinetics may lead to clinical misjudgements.                                         Hypothesis               : GRFs of tölting Icelandic horses will be comparable in profile and magnitude with those of trotting horses.                                         Methods               : Forelimb and hindlimb GRFs were obtained for 10 Icelandic horses ridden at a tölt. These data were evaluated across 3 speed ranges: {$<$}2, 2.5–5 and {$>$}5 m/sec.                                         Results               : Virtually all vertical force tracings were single‐peaked. Forelimbs typically had greater peak vertical forces and impulses compared with hindlimbs. Support duration and forelimb vertical impulse were correlated negatively with speed, whereas peak vertical, braking and propulsive forces and hindlimb braking and propulsive impulses were correlated positively with speed.                                         Conclusions               : GRF profiles of tölting Icelandic horses are more similar to profiles of trots than walks, suggesting that tölts follow bouncing mechanics.                                         Potential relevance               : Greater overlap of limb support in 4‐beat gaits (even at high speeds) is associated with lower peak vertical force magnitudes of tölts compared with those reported for trots at comparable speeds, which may help limit the occurrence of overloading injuries in Icelandic horses.},

  abstract = {Cursorial ground birds are paragons of bipedal running that span a 500-fold mass range from quail to ostrich. Here we investigate the task-level control priorities of cursorial birds by analysing how they negotiate single-step obstacles that create a conflict between body stability (attenuating deviations in body motion) and consistent leg force–length dynamics (for economy and leg safety). We also test the hypothesis that control priorities shift between body stability and leg safety with increasing body size, reflecting use of active control to overcome size-related challenges. Weight-support demands lead to a shift towards straighter legs and stiffer steady gait with increasing body size, but it remains unknown whether non-steady locomotor priorities diverge with size. We found that all measured species used a consistent obstacle negotiation strategy, involving unsteady body dynamics to minimise fluctuations in leg posture and loading across multiple steps, not directly prioritising body stability. Peak leg forces remained remarkably consistent across obstacle terrain, within 0.35 body weights of level running for obstacle heights from 0.1 to 0.5 times leg length. All species used similar stance leg actuation patterns, involving asymmetric force–length trajectories and posture-dependent actuation to add or remove energy depending on landing conditions. We present a simple stance leg model that explains key features of avian bipedal locomotion, and suggests economy as a key priority on both level and uneven terrain. We suggest that running ground birds target the closely coupled priorities of economy and leg safety as the direct imperatives of control, with adequate stability achieved through appropriately tuned intrinsic dynamics.},

  abstract = {The arrangement and physiology of muscle fibres can strongly influence musculoskeletal function and whole-organismal performance. However, experimental investigation of muscle function during               in vivo               activity is typically limited to relatively few muscles in a given system. Computational models and simulations of the musculoskeletal system can partly overcome these limitations, by exploring the dynamics of muscles, tendons and other tissues in a robust and quantitative fashion. Here, a high-fidelity, 26-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model was developed of the hindlimb of a small ground bird, the elegant-crested tinamou (               Eudromia elegans               , \textasciitilde 550 g), including all the major muscles of the limb (36 actuators per leg). The model was integrated with biplanar fluoroscopy (XROMM) and forceplate data for walking and running, where dynamic optimization was used to estimate muscle excitations and fibre length changes throughout both gaits. Following this, a series of static simulations over the total range of physiological limb postures were performed, to circumscribe the bounds of possible variation in fibre length. During gait, fibre lengths for all muscles remained between 0.5 to 1.21 times optimal fibre length, but operated mostly on the ascending limb and plateau of the active force-length curve, a result that parallels previous experimental findings for birds, humans and other species. However, the ranges of fibre length varied considerably among individual muscles, especially when considered across the total possible range of joint excursion. Net length change of muscle–tendon units was mostly less than optimal fibre length, sometimes markedly so, suggesting that approaches that use muscle–tendon length change to estimate optimal fibre length in extinct species are likely underestimating this important parameter for many muscles. The results of this study clarify and broaden understanding of muscle function in extant animals, and can help refine approaches used to study extinct species.},

  abstract = {The intersection of paleontology and biomechanics can be reciprocally illuminating, helping to improve paleobiological knowledge of extinct species and furthering our understanding of the generality of biomechanical principles derived from study of extant species. However, working with data gleaned primarily from the fossil record has its challenges. Building on decades of prior research, we outline and critically discuss a complete workflow for biomechanical analysis of extinct species, using locomotor biomechanics in the Triassic theropod dinosaur Coelophysis as a case study. We progress from the digital capture of fossil bone morphology to creating rigged skeletal models, to reconstructing musculature and soft tissue volumes, to the development of computational musculoskeletal models, and finally to the execution of biomechanical simulations. Using a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model comprising 33 muscles, a static inverse simulation of the mid-stance of running shows that Coelophysis probably used more upright (extended) hindlimb postures and was likely capable of withstanding a vertical ground reaction force of magnitude more than 2.5 times body weight. We identify muscle force-generating capacity as a key source of uncertainty in the simulations, highlighting the need for more refined methods of estimating intrinsic muscle parameters such as fiber length. Our approach emphasizes the explicit application of quantitative techniques and physics-based principles, which helps maximize results robustness and reproducibility. Although we focus on one specific taxon and question, many of the techniques and philosophies explored here have much generality to them, so they can be applied in biomechanical investigation of other extinct organisms.}

Current digital methods for quantifying articular function depend on exhaustively sampling all possible joint poses, but this is computationally intensive, becoming prohibitively so with more degrees of freedom. This has impeded more sophisticated analyses or broader application of these methods to more diverse questions and species.                                                                          The present study introduces ‘APSE’ (                     A                     ccelerated                     P                     ose                     S                     earching with                     E                     lectrostatics), an iterative algorithm for rapidly and intelligently sampling high‐dimensional joint pose space to quantify articular function and mobility. Key features of the algorithm are: known viable joint poses inform the search for new poses in successive generations; the search preferentially targets under‐explored regions of pose space, while avoiding over‐explored regions; large swaths of inviable pose space are never evaluated, thus minimizing wasted time; and parallelizability. The efficacy of the algorithm was benchmarked with diverse theoretical and biological joints. As a case study to demonstrate its utility, APSE was used to investigate mobility in the enigmatic shoulder joint of the extinct ‘pelycosaur’‐grade synapsid                     Dimetrodon                     , the function of which has been widely debated.                                                                                             APSE produces high‐dimensional joint mobility assessments with greater precision than state‐of‐the‐art exhaustive sampling methods. More viable poses are identified at a greater sampling density, but in a fraction of the time taken by current methods (hours, not days or weeks). Results for                     Dimetrodon                     shoulder mobility indicate strong coupling between most degrees of freedom across the joint's full range of motion, a stark contrast to the flexible shoulder of most extant tetrapods.                                                                        APSE provides a time‐efficient means to quantitatively measure articular function and mobility, especially when more degrees of freedom are considered. By greatly reducing computational requirements, APSE lowers the barrier to researchers seeking to undertake more complex or more numerous analyses of articular function in modern and extinct animals. This will accelerate the pace of research in comparative or evolutionary analyses of joint and animal function.},

  abstract = {How extinct, non-avian theropod dinosaurs locomoted is a subject of considerable interest, as is the manner in which it evolved on the line leading to birds. Fossil footprints provide the most direct evidence for answering these questions. In this study, step width—the mediolateral (transverse) distance between successive footfalls—was investigated with respect to speed (stride length) in non-avian theropod trackways of Late Triassic age. Comparable kinematic data were also collected for humans and 11 species of ground-dwelling birds. Permutation tests of the slope on a plot of step width against stride length showed that step width decreased continuously with increasing speed in the extinct theropods (               p               {$<$} 0.001), as well as the five tallest bird species studied (               p               {$<$} 0.01). Humans, by contrast, showed an abrupt decrease in step width at the walk–run transition. In the modern bipeds, these patterns reflect the use of either a discontinuous locomotor repertoire, characterized by distinct gaits (humans), or a continuous locomotor repertoire, where walking smoothly transitions into running (birds). The non-avian theropods are consequently inferred to have had a continuous locomotor repertoire, possibly including grounded running. Thus, features that characterize avian terrestrial locomotion had begun to evolve early in theropod history.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle mass, architecture and force-generating capacity are well known to scale with body size in animals, both throughout ontogeny and across species. Investigations of limb muscle scaling in terrestrial amniotes typically focus on individual muscles within select clades, but here this question was examined at the level of the whole limb across amniotes generally. In particular, the present study explored how muscle mass, force-generating capacity (measured by physiological cross-sectional area) and internal architecture (fascicle length) scales in the fore- and hindlimbs of extant mammals, non-avian saurians (‘reptiles’) and bipeds (birds and humans). Sixty species spanning almost five orders of magnitude in body mass were investigated, comprising previously published architectural data and new data obtainedviadissections of the opossumDidelphis virginianaand the tegu lizardSalvator merianae. Phylogenetic generalized least squares was used to determine allometric scaling slopes (exponents) and intercepts, to assess whether patterns previously reported for individual muscles or functional groups were retained at the level of the whole limb, and to test whether mammals, reptiles and bipeds followed different allometric trajectories. In general, patterns of scaling observed in individual muscles were also observed in the whole limb. Reptiles generally have proportionately lower muscle mass and force-generating capacity compared to mammals, especially at larger body size, and bipeds exhibit strong to extreme positive allometry in the distal hindlimb. Remarkably, when muscle mass was accounted for in analyses of muscle force-generating capacity, reptiles, mammals and bipeds almost ubiquitously followed a single common scaling pattern, implying that differences in whole-limb force-generating capacity are principally driven by differences in muscle mass, not internal architecture. In addition to providing a novel perspective on skeletal muscle allometry in animals, the new dataset assembled was used to generate pan-amniote statistical relationships that can be used to predict muscle mass or force-generating capacity in extinct amniotes, helping to inform future reconstructions of musculoskeletal function in the fossil record.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The purpose of the present study was to gain more insight into the contribution of the forelimbs and hindlimbs of the horse to energy changes during the push-off for a jump. For this purpose, we collected kinematic data at 240 Hz from 23 5-year-old Warmbloods (average mass: 595 kg) performing free jumps over a 1.15 m high fence. From these data, we calculated the changes in mechanical energy and the changes in limb length and joint angles. The force carried by the forelimbs and the amount of energy stored was estimated from the distance between elbow and hoof, assuming that this part of the leg behaved as a linear spring. During the forelimb push, the total energy first decreased by 3.2 J kg-1 and then increased again by 4.2 J kg-1 to the end of the forelimb push. At the end of the forelimb push, the kinetic energy due to horizontal velocity of the centre of mass was 1.6 J kg-1 less than at the start, while the effective energy(energy contributing to jump height) was 2.3 J kg-1 greater. It was investigated to what extent these changes could involve passive spring-like behaviour of the forelimbs. The amount of energy stored and re-utilized in the distal tendons during the forelimb push was estimated to be on average 0.4 J kg-1 in the trailing forelimb and 0.23 J kg-1 in the leading forelimb. This means that a considerable amount of energy was first dissipated and subsequently regenerated by muscles, with triceps brachii probably being the most important contributor. During the hindlimb push, the muscles of the leg were primarily producing energy. The total increase in energy was 2.5 J kg-1 and the peak power output amounted to 71 W kg-1.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The purpose of this study was to determine whether individual limb forces could be calculated accurately from kinematics of trotting and walking horses. We collected kinematic data and measured vertical ground reaction forces on the individual limbs of seven Warmblood dressage horses, trotting at 3.4 m s–1 and walking at 1.6 m s–1 on a treadmill. First, using a segmental model, we calculated from kinematics the total ground reaction force vector and its moment arm relative to each of the hoofs. Second, for phases in which the body was supported by only two limbs, we calculated the individual reaction forces on these limbs. Third, we assumed that the distal limbs operated as linear springs, and determined their force–length relationships using calculated individual limb forces at trot. Finally, we calculated individual limb force–time histories from distal limb lengths. A good correspondence was obtained between calculated and measured individual limb forces. At trot, the average peak vertical reaction force on the forelimb was calculated to be 11.5±0.9 N kg–1 and measured to be 11.7±0.9 N kg–1, and for the hindlimb these values were 9.8±0.7 N kg–1 and 10.0±0.6 N kg–1,respectively. At walk, the average peak vertical reaction force on the forelimb was calculated to be 6.9±0.5 N kg–1 and measured to be 7.1±0.3 N kg–1, and for the hindlimb these values were 4.8±0.5 N kg–1 and 4.7±0.3 N kg–1, respectively. It was concluded that the proposed method of calculating individual limb reaction forces is sufficiently accurate to detect changes in loading reported in the literature for mild to moderate lameness at trot.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A quantitative kinematic analysis of the movements of the shoulder girdle in the three dimensions of space during treadmill locomotion (velocity range 0.33–1.2 m/s) was performed in two cats. Since the movement patterns of the scapula and the humeroscapular joint can only vaguely be estimated through the overlying skin we used implanted metal spheres placed on the scapula in combination with three‐dimensional pulsed X‐ray cinematography (time resolution 20 ms) to reconstruct the excursions of the scapula, the humerus and the elbow and to calculate the respective angular amplitudes and velocities. The movements of the scapula relative to the Th4 spinous process consist of four major components: (i) a monophasic flexion (caudocranial movement of the glenoid fossa during swing)/extension (craniocaudal movement of the glenoid fossa during stance) sequence, the fulcrum for which sequence is situated near the vertebral border of the scapula at the medial elongation of the scapular spine; (ii) a vertical monophasic up/down sequence of the fulcrum relative to the trunk, the highest vertical position being reached during mid‐stance and the lowest vertical position during mid‐swing; (iii) a biphasic abduction/adduction sequence during swing and during stance respectively; and (iv) small rotations along the scapular spine. The trajectory recordings of the scapula indicate that the scapula yields relative to the trunk under the body weight after ground contact. The angular excursions of the humeroscapular joint consist of: (i) a flexion/extension sequence during swing, a yield after ground contact and a final extension at the end of stance; (ii) an adduction and outward rotation during the early swing phase flexion; (iii) an abduction and inward rotation during the late swing phase extension; and (iv) an adduction during the yield with only minor rotations during the whole stance phase. The movement patterns are discussed in view of the muscular synergies necessary to guide the scapula and the humerus during stance and swing, and in relation to the implications for the organization of these patterns in spinal neuronal systems.},

The roles of two signalling pathways implicated in muscle hypertrophy on the basis of findings in vitro, Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), were investigated in several models of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy in vivo. The Akt/mTOR pathway was upregulated during hypertrophy and downregulated during muscle atrophy. Furthermore, rapamycin, a selective blocker of mTOR, blocked hypertrophy in all models tested, without causing atrophy in control muscles. In contrast, the calcineurin pathway was not activated during hypertrophy in vivo, and inhibitors of calcineurin, cyclosporin A and FK506 did not blunt hypertrophy. Finally, genetic activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway was sufficient to cause hypertrophy and prevent atrophy in vivo, whereas genetic blockade of this pathway blocked hypertrophy in vivo. We conclude that the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway and its downstream targets, p70S6K and PHAS-1/4E-BP1, is requisitely involved in regulating skeletal muscle fibre size, and that activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway can oppose muscle atrophy induced by disuse.},

This study determined the key biomechanical and physiological characteristics of this running pattern, i.e., grounded running (GR), and compared these characteristics with slow aerial running (SAR) and reference data on walking at the same slow running speed.                                         Methods                                Thirty male subjects performed instructed GR and SAR at 2.10 m·s                 −1                 on a treadmill. Ground reaction forces, tibial accelerations, and metabolic rate were measured to estimate general musculoskeletal loading (external power and maximal vertical ground reaction force), impact intensity (vertical instantaneous loading rate and tibial acceleration), and energy expenditure. More explicit measures of muscular loading (muscle stresses and peak eccentric power) were calculated based on a representative subsample, in which detailed kinematics and kinetics were recorded. We hypothesized that all measures would be lower for the GR condition.                                                        Results               Subjects successfully altered their running pattern upon a simple instruction toward a GR pattern by increasing their duty factor from 41.5\% to 51.2\%. As hypothesized, impact intensity, general measures for musculoskeletal, and the more explicit measures for muscular loading decreased by up to 35.0\%, 20.3\%, and 34.0\%, respectively, compared with SAR. Contrary to our hypothesis, metabolic rate showed an increase of 4.8\%.                                         Conclusions               Changing running style from SAR to GR reduces musculoskeletal loading without lowering the metabolic energy requirements. As such, GR might be beneficial for most runners as it has the potential to reduce the risk of running-related injuries while remaining a moderate to vigorous form of physical activity, contributing to fulfillment of the recommendations concerning physical activity and public health.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Running with increased duty factors (DF) has been shown to effectively reduce external forces during running. In this study, we investigated whether running with increased DF (INCR) also reduces internal musculoskeletal loading measures, defined as peak muscle forces, muscle force impulses, and peak joint contact forces compared with a runners' preferred running pattern (PREF). METHOD: Ten subjects were instructed to run with increased DF at 2.1 m·s -1 . Ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics were simultaneously measured. A musculoskeletal model was used to estimate muscle forces based on a dynamic optimization approach, which in turn were used to calculate muscle force impulses and (resultant and three-dimensional) joint contact forces of the ankle, knee, and hip joint during stance. RESULTS: Runners successfully increased their DF from 40.6\% to 49.2\% on average. This reduced peak muscle forces of muscles that contribute to support during running, i.e., the ankle plantar flexors (-19\%), knee extensors (-18\%), and hip extensors (-15\%). As a consequence, peak joint contact forces of the ankle, knee, and hip joint reduced in the INCR condition. However, several hip flexors generated higher peak muscle forces near the end of stance. CONCLUSIONS: Running with increased DF lowers internal loading measures related to support during stance. Although some swing-related muscles generated higher forces near the end of stance, running with increased DF can be considered as a preventive strategy to reduce the occurrence of running-related injuries, especially in running populations that are prone to overuse injuries.},

XROMM methods include: (1) manual alignment (registration) of bone models to video sequences, i.e., Scientific Rotoscoping; (2) computer vision‐based autoregistration of bone models to biplanar X‐ray videos; and (3) marker‐based registration of bone models to biplanar X‐ray videos. Here, we describe a novel set of X‐ray hardware, software, and workflows for marker‐based XROMM. Refurbished C‐arm fluoroscopes retrofitted with high‐speed video cameras offer a relatively inexpensive X‐ray hardware solution for comparative biomechanics research. Precision for our biplanar C‐arm hardware and analysis software, measured as the standard deviation of pairwise distances between 1\,mm tantalum markers embedded in rigid objects, was found to be ±0.046\,mm under optimal conditions and ±0.084\,mm under actual in vivo recording conditions. Mean error in measurement of a known distance between two beads was within the 0.01\,mm fabrication tolerance of the test object, and mean absolute error was 0.037\,mm. Animating 3D bone models from sets of marker positions (XROMM animation) makes it possible to study skeletal kinematics in the context of detailed bone morphology. The biplanar fluoroscopy hardware and computational methods described here should make XROMM an accessible and useful addition to the available technologies for studying the form, function, and evolution of vertebrate animals.

  abstract = {The external appearance of the dodo (               Raphus cucullatus,               Linnaeus, 1758) has been a source of considerable intrigue, as contemporaneous accounts or depictions are rare. The body mass of the dodo has been particularly contentious, with the flightless pigeon alternatively reconstructed as slim or fat depending upon the skeletal metric used as the basis for mass prediction. Resolving this dichotomy and obtaining a reliable estimate for mass is essential before future analyses regarding dodo life history, physiology or biomechanics can be conducted. Previous mass estimates of the dodo have relied upon predictive equations based upon hind limb dimensions of extant pigeons. Yet the hind limb proportions of dodo have been found to differ considerably from those of their modern relatives, particularly with regards to midshaft diameter. Therefore, application of predictive equations to unusually robust fossil skeletal elements may bias mass estimates. We present a whole-body computed tomography (CT) -based mass estimation technique for application to the dodo. We generate 3D volumetric renders of the articulated skeletons of 20 species of extant pigeons, and wrap minimum-fit ‘convex hulls’ around their bony extremities. Convex hull volume is subsequently regressed against mass to generate predictive models based upon whole skeletons. Our best-performing predictive model is characterized by high correlation coefficients and low mean squared error (               a               = − 2.31,               b               = 0.90,               r               2               = 0.97, MSE = 0.0046). When applied to articulated composite skeletons of the dodo (National Museums Scotland, NMS.Z.1993.13; Natural History Museum, NHMUK A.9040 and S/1988.50.1), we estimate eviscerated body masses of 8–10.8 kg. When accounting for missing soft tissues, this may equate to live masses of 10.6–14.3 kg. Mass predictions presented here overlap at the lower end of those previously published, and support recent suggestions of a relatively slim dodo. CT-based reconstructions provide a means of objectively estimating mass and body segment properties of extinct species using whole articulated skeletons.},

  abstract = {Classic beam theory is frequently used in biomechanics to model the stress behaviour of vertebrate long bones, particularly when creating intraspecific scaling models. Although methodologically straightforward, classic beam theory requires complex irregular bones to be approximated as slender beams, and the errors associated with simplifying complex organic structures to such an extent are unknown. Alternative approaches, such as finite element analysis (FEA), while much more time-consuming to perform, require no such assumptions. This study compares the results obtained using classic beam theory with those from FEA to quantify the beam theory errors and to provide recommendations about when a full FEA is essential for reasonable biomechanical predictions. High-resolution computed tomographic scans of eight vertebrate long bones were used to calculate diaphyseal stress owing to various loading regimes. Under compression, FEA values of minimum principal stress ( σ min ) were on average 142 per cent (±28\% s.e.) larger than those predicted by beam theory, with deviation between the two models correlated to shaft curvature (two-tailed p = 0.03, r 2 = 0.56). Under bending, FEA values of maximum principal stress ( σ max ) and beam theory values differed on average by 12 per cent (±4\% s.e.), with deviation between the models significantly correlated to cross-sectional asymmetry at midshaft (two-tailed p = 0.02, r 2 = 0.62). In torsion, assuming maximum stress values occurred at the location of minimum cortical thickness brought beam theory and FEA values closest in line, and in this case FEA values of τ torsion were on average 14 per cent (±5\% s.e.) higher than beam theory. Therefore, FEA is the preferred modelling solution when estimates of absolute diaphyseal stress are required, although values calculated by beam theory for bending may be acceptable in some situations.},

  abstract = {The moment arm of a muscle defines its leverage around a given joint. In a clinical setting, the quantification of muscle moment arms is an important means of establishing the ‘healthy’ functioning of a muscle and in identifying and treating musculoskeletal abnormalities. Elsewhere in modern animal taxa, moment arm studies aim to illuminate adaptions of the musculoskeletal system towards particular locomotor or feeding behaviors. In the absence of kinematic data, paleontologists have likewise relied upon estimated muscle moment arms as a means of reconstructing musculoskeletal function and biomechanical performance in fossil species. With the application of ‘virtual paleontological’ techniques, it is possible to generate increasingly detailed musculoskeletal models of extinct taxa. However, the steps taken to derive such models of complex systems are seldom reported in detail. Here we present a case study for calculating three-dimensional muscle moment arms using Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887, to highlight both the potential and the limitations of this approach in vertebrate paleontology. We find the technique to be mostly insensitive to choices in muscle modeling parameters (particularly relative to other sources of uncertainty in paleontological studies), although exceptions do exist. Of more concern is the current lack of consensus on what functional signals, if any, are contained within moment arm data derived from extant species. Until a correlation between muscle moment arm and function can be broadly identified across a range of modern taxa, the interpretation of moment arms calculated for extinct taxa should be approached with caution.

  abstract = {A detailed osteological description of Tyrannosaurus rex Osborn, 1905 is presented, based primarily on the most complete specimen yet collected of this taxon (FMNH PR2081, popularly known as “Sue”) but also including observations from other specimens. Skull morphology of FMNH PR2081 is largely congruent with that described for previous specimens, but new details are added. Palatal morphology of FMNH PR2081 differs slightly from that of previously-described specimens—the internal choanae are slightly larger relative to skull size, and the anterior expansion of the fused vomers is elongate. Posteriorly, the vomers pass medially for nearly the entire length of the pterygoids. High-resolution x-ray computed tomographic (CT) analysis of the skull reveals internal details not previously observed. Complex recess systems can be traced in the jugal, lacrymal, ectopterygoid, quadrate, exoccipital, supraoccipital, prootic, and basioccipital. The exoccipital recess was perforated by a small foramen on the posterodorsal surface of the paroccipital process, and may have communicated with pneumatic chambers in the atlas-axis complex. The maxillary antra were bound medially by a thin bony wall; traces of these walls in earlier CT studies of tyrannosaurid skulls may have led to the impression that these animals had bony maxillonasal turbintes. A digital endocast was constructed from these images, confirming many previous observations based on natural endocasts, but also yielding new details, such as the presence of a large and presumably pneumatic sinus in the prootic adjacent to the pathway for the maxillary-mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve. The olfactory bulbs were very large. The postcranium is also largely congruent with previously published descriptions. The precaudal vertebral column was heavily pneumatized, with pneumatopores penetrating the centra and neural arches of all presacral vertebrae, the cervical ribs, and the anteriormost four sacral centra. Unusual structures are tentatively identified as a proatlas arch and a rib on the last presacral vertebrae, structures previously thought absent from tyrannosaurids. The “missing chevron” partially responsible for claims that FMNH PR2081 is female was actually present. The gastralia are extensively fused anteriorly, and the morphology of the anteriormost gastral segments closely resembles the only published account of a tyrannosaurid sternum. This raises several possibilities, including the complete absence of a bony sternum in tyrannosaurids. The appendicular skeleton is congruent with those of other tyrannosaurids. A slender rodlike bone may represent a partial furcula, but this is not certain. The scapulocoracoids would probably not have met at the midline, but would nonetheless have closely approached each other in articulation. Several abnormalities in the skeleton have attracted popular attention. There is no defensible evidence for bite trauma on the skull, but the rib cage does show evidence for healed fractures. Lesions on the right scapulocoracoid and humerus coincide with fractured ribs on the right cervical-dorsal transition and may indicate a single trauma to the right side of the body. The left fibula is pathological, but may not have been fractured. Two fused tail vertebrae may preserve natural molds of the tail muscles. © 2002 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.},

  abstract = {Biomechanical modelling is a powerful tool for quantifying the evolution of functional performance in extinct animals to understand key anatomical innovations and selective pressures driving major evolutionary radiations. However, the fossil record is composed predominantly of hard parts, forcing palaeontologists to reconstruct soft tissue properties in such models. Rarely are these reconstruction approaches validated on extant animals, despite soft tissue properties being highly determinant of functional performance. The extent to which soft tissue reconstructions and biomechanical models accurately predict quantitative or even qualitative patterns in macroevolutionary studies is therefore unknown. Here, we modelled the masticatory system in extant rodents to objectively test the ability of current muscle reconstruction methods to correctly identify quantitative and qualitative differences between macroevolutionary morphotypes. Baseline models generated using measured soft tissue properties yielded differences in muscle proportions, bite force, and bone stress expected between extant sciuromorph, myomorph, and hystricomorph rodents. However, predictions from models generated using reconstruction methods typically used in fossil studies varied widely from high levels of quantitative accuracy to a failure to correctly capture even relative differences between macroevolutionary morphotypes. Our novel experiment emphasizes that correctly reconstructing even qualitative differences between taxa in a macroevolutionary radiation is challenging using current methods. Future studies of fossil taxa should incorporate systematic assessments of reconstruction error into their hypothesis testing and, moreover, seek to expand primary datasets on muscle properties in extant taxa to better inform soft tissue reconstructions in macroevolutionary studies.},

  abstract = {Falling poses a major threat to the steadily growing population of the elderly in modern-day society. A major challenge in the prevention of falls is the identification of individuals who are at risk of falling owing to an unstable gait. At present, several methods are available for estimating gait stability, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we review the currently available measures: the maximum Lyapunov exponent (               λ               S               and               λ               L               ), the maximum Floquet multiplier, variability measures, long-range correlations, extrapolated centre of mass, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, foot placement estimator, gait sensitivity norm and maximum allowable perturbation. We explain what these measures represent and how they are calculated, and we assess their validity, divided up into construct validity, predictive validity in simple models, convergent validity in experimental studies, and predictive validity in observational studies. We conclude that (i) the validity of variability measures and               λ               S               is best supported across all levels, (ii) the maximum Floquet multiplier and               λ               L               have good construct validity, but negative predictive validity in models, negative convergent validity and (for               λ               L               ) negative predictive validity in observational studies, (iii) long-range correlations lack construct validity and predictive validity in models and have negative convergent validity, and (iv) measures derived from perturbation experiments have good construct validity, but data are lacking on convergent validity in experimental studies and predictive validity in observational studies. In closing, directions for future research on dynamic gait stability are discussed.},

This research investigated the potential impacts of drone monitoring on a large terrestrial mammal, the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), in urban and peri-urban environments. We assessed the response of kangaroos to drone monitoring by analysing kangaroo behaviour prior to and during drone deployments using a linear modelling approach. We also explored factors that influenced kangaroo responses including drone altitude, site characteristics and kangaroo population dynamics and demographics. We showed that drones elicit a vigilance response, but that kangaroos rarely fled from the drone. However, kangaroos were most likely to flee from a drone flown at an altitude of 30 m. This study suggests that drone altitude is a key consideration for minimising disturbance of large terrestrial mammals and that drone flights at an altitude of 60–100 m above ground level will minimise behavioural impacts. It also highlights the need for more research to assess the level of intrusion and other impacts that drone surveys have on the behaviour of wildlife and the accuracy of the data produced.},

An understanding of the sarcomere length changes that occur during movement provides insights into the physiological importance of this relationship and may provide insights into the design of certain muscle/joint combinations. The purpose of this review is to summarize and analyze the available literature regarding published sarcomere length operating ranges reported for various species. Our secondary purpose is to apply analytical techniques to determine whether generalizations can be made regarding the “normal” sarcomere length operating range of skeletal muscle. The analysis suggests that many muscles operate over a narrow range of sarcomere lengths, covering 94+/−13 \% of optimal sarcomere length. Sarcomere length measurements are found to be systematically influenced by the rigor state and methods used to make these measurements.}

  abstract = {Equine digital flexor muscles have independent tendons but a nearly identical mechanical relationship to the main joint they act upon. Yet these muscles have remarkable diversity in architecture, ranging from long, unipennate fibers (“short” compartment of DDF) to very short, multipennate fibers (SDF). To investigate the functional relevance of the form of the digital flexor muscles, fiber contractile properties were analyzed in the context of architecture differences and in vivo function during locomotion. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform fiber type was studied, and in vitro motility assays were used to measure actin filament sliding velocity (V               f               ). Skinned fiber contractile properties [isometric tension (P               0               /CSA), velocity of unloaded shortening (V               US               ), and force-Ca               2+               relationships] at both 10 and 30°C were characterized. Contractile properties were correlated with MHC isoform and their respective V               f               . The DDF contained a higher percentage of MHC-2A fibers with myosin (heavy meromyosin) and V               f               that was twofold faster than SDF. At 30°C, P               0               /CSA was higher for DDF (103.5 ± 8.75 mN/mm               2               ) than SDF fibers (81.8 ± 7.71 mN/mm               2               ). Similarly, V               US               (pCa 5, 30°C) was faster for DDF (2.43 ± 0.53 FL/s) than SDF fibers (1.20 ± 0.22 FL/s). Active isometric tension increased with increasing Ca               2+               concentration, with maximal Ca               2+               activation at pCa 5 at each temperature in fibers from each muscle. In general, the collective properties of DDF and SDF were consistent with fiber MHC isoform composition, muscle architecture, and the respective functional roles of the two muscles in locomotion.},

  abstract = {Objective: To multidimensionally investigate common vocal effects in experienced professional nonclassical singers, to examine their mechanism of production and reproducibility, to demonstrate the existence of partial glottal vibration, and to assess the potential of damage to the voice from nonclassical singing. Study Design: Individual cohort study. Methods: Ten male singers aged between 25 and 46 years (34 ± 7 years [mean ± SD]) with different stylistic backgrounds were recruited (five pop/rock/metal, five musical theater). Participants repeatedly presented the usual nonclassical vocal effects and techniques in their repertoire. All performances were documented and analyzed using established instruments (eg, auditory-perceptual assessment, videolaryngostroboscopy, electroglottography, voice function diagnostics). Results: The vocal apparatus of all singers was healthy and capable of high performance. Typical nonclassical vocal effects were breathy voice, creaky voice, vocal fry, grunting, distortion, rattle, belt, and twang. All effects could be easily differentiated from each other. They were intraindividually consistently repeatable and also interindividually produced in a similar manner. A special feature in one singer was the first evidence of partial glottal vibration when belting in the high register. The unintended transition to this reduced voice quality was accompanied by physical fatigue and inflexible respiratory support. Conclusion: The long-lasting use of the investigated nonclassical vocal effects had no negative impact on trained singers. The possibility of long-term damage depends on the individual constitution, specific use, duration, and extent of the hyperfunction. The incidence of partial glottal vibration and its consequences require continuing research to learn more about efficient and healthy vocal function in nonclassical singing.},

  abstract = {Embodied agents in continuous control domains have had limited exposure to tasks allowing to explore musculoskeletal properties that enable agile and nimble behaviors in biological beings. The sophistication behind neuro-musculoskeletal control can pose new challenges for the motor learning community. At the same time, agents solving complex neural control problems allow impact in fields such as neuro-rehabilitation, as well as collaborative-robotics. Human biomechanics underlies complex multi-joint-multi-actuator musculoskeletal systems. The sensory-motor system relies on a range of sensory-contact rich and proprioceptive inputs that define and condition muscle actuation required to exhibit intelligent behaviors in the physical world. Current frameworks for musculoskeletal control do not support physiological sophistication of the musculoskeletal systems along with physical world interaction capabilities. In addition, they are neither embedded in complex and skillful motor tasks nor are computationally effective and scalable to study large-scale learning paradigms. Here, we present MyoSuite -- a suite of physiologically accurate biomechanical models of elbow, wrist, and hand, with physical contact capabilities, which allow learning of complex and skillful contact-rich real-world tasks. We provide diverse motor-control challenges: from simple postural control to skilled hand-object interactions such as turning a key, twirling a pen, rotating two balls in one hand, etc. By supporting physiological alterations in musculoskeletal geometry (tendon transfer), assistive devices (exoskeleton assistance), and muscle contraction dynamics (muscle fatigue, sarcopenia), we present real-life tasks with temporal changes, thereby exposing realistic non-stationary conditions in our tasks which most continuous control benchmarks lack.},

  abstract = {Identifying tradeoffs between hunting and scavenging in an ecological context is important for understanding predatory guilds. In the past century, the feeding strategy of one of the largest and best-known terrestrial carnivores,            Tyrannosaurus rex            , has been the subject of much debate: was it an active predator or an obligate scavenger? Here we look at the feasibility of an adult            T. rex            being an obligate scavenger in the environmental conditions of Late Cretaceous North America, given the size distributions of sympatric herbivorous dinosaurs and likely competition with more abundant small-bodied theropods. We predict that nearly 50 per cent of herbivores would have been within a 55–85 kg range, and calculate based on expected encounter rates that carcasses from these individuals would have been quickly consumed by smaller theropods. Larger carcasses would have been very rare and heavily competed for, making them an unreliable food source. The potential carcass search rates of smaller theropods are predicted to be 14–60 times that of an adult            T. rex            . Our results suggest that            T. rex            and other extremely large carnivorous dinosaurs would have been unable to compete as obligate scavengers and would have primarily hunted large vertebrate prey, similar to many large mammalian carnivores in modern-day ecosystems.},

The first example is of the small predator Velociraptor OSBORN, 1924 buried with its prey, Protoceratops GRANGER \& GREGORY, 1923. As interpreted, the right forearm of the Velociraptor is between the clenched beak of the Protoceratops, the left hand of the Velociraptor is grasping the face of the Protoceratops, and the sickle claw of the right foot of the Velociraptor is extended into what was the throat of the prey. The second example is a section of mutilated caudal neural spines in an adult specimen of the hadrosaur Edmontosaurus LAMBE, 1920. The damage suggests an attack by a very large theropod believed to have been Tyrannosaurus OSBORN, 1905. Bone regrowth indicates that the hadrosaur survived the attack, and that the damage could not have been caused by scavenging. These two examples suggest that both small and large theropods, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus in particular, could actively hunt and attack prey species.},

Using this extant phylogenetic bracket, we are able to offer well-supported inferences concerning most of the hindlimb musculature in this taxon. We also refrain from making any inferences for certain muscles where the resulting optimizations are ambiguous. This reconstruction differs from several previous attempts and we evaluate these discrepancies. In addition to providing a new and more detailed understanding of the hindlimb morphology of T. rex - the largest known terrestrial biped - this reconstruction also helps to clarify the sequence of character-state change along the line to extant birds. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background                                During the growth of complex multicellular organisms, chronological age, size and morphology change together in a hierarchical and coordinated pattern. Among extinct species, the growth of                 Tyrannosaurus rex                 has received repeated attention through quantitative analyses of relative maturity and chronological age. Its growth series shows an extreme transformation from shallow skulls in juveniles to deep skulls in adults along with a reduction in tooth count, and its growth curve shows that                 T. rex                 had a high growth rate in contrast to its closest relatives. However, separately, these sets of data provide an incomplete picture of the congruence between age, size, and relative maturity in this exemplar species. The goal of this work is to analyze these data sets together using cladistic analysis to produce a single hypothesis of growth that includes all of the relevant data.                                                        Methods               The three axes of growth were analyzed together using cladistic analysis, based on a data set of 1,850 morphological characters and 44 specimens. The analysis was run in TNT v.1.5 under a New Technology search followed by a Traditional search. Correlation tests were run in IBM SPSS Statistics v. 24.0.0.0.                                         Results                                An initial analysis that included all of the specimens recovered 50 multiple most parsimonious ontograms a series of analyses identified 13 wildcard specimens. An analysis run without the wildcard specimens recovered a single most parsimonious tree (i.e., ontogram) of 3,053 steps. The ontogram is composed of 21 growth stages, and all but the first and third are supported by unambiguously optimized synontomorphies.                 T. rex                 ontogeny can be divided into five discrete growth categories that are diagnosed by chronological age, morphology, and, in part, size (uninformative among adults). The topology shows that the transition from shallow to deep skull shape occurred between 13 and 15 years of age, and the size of the immediate relatives of                 T. rex                 was exceeded between its 15th and 18th years. Although size and maturity are congruent among juveniles and subadults, congruence is not seen among adults; for example, one of the least mature adults (RSM 2523.8) is also the largest and most massive example of the species. The extreme number of changes at the transition between juveniles and subadults shows that the ontogeny of                 T. rex                 exhibits secondary metamorphosis, analogous to the abrupt ontogenetic changes that are seen at sexual maturity among teleosts. These results provide a point of comparison for testing the congruence between maturity and chronological age, size, and mass, as well as integrating previous work on functional morphology into a rigorous ontogenetic framework. Comparison of the growth series of                 T. rex                 with those of outgroup taxa clarifies the ontogenetic trends that were inherited from the common ancestor of Archosauriformes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Dynamic gearing is a mechanism that has been suggested to enhance the performance of skeletal muscles by maintaining them at the shortening velocities that maximize their power or efficiency. We investigated this hypothesis in three domestic dogs during trotting and galloping. We used ground force recordings and kinematic analysis to calculate the changes in gear ratio that occur during the production of the external work of locomotion. We also monitored length changes of the vastus lateralis muscle, an extensor muscle of the knee, using sonomicrometry in four additional dogs to determine the nature and rate of active shortening of this muscle. During both trotting and galloping, the gear ratios of the extensor muscles of the elbow, wrist and ankle joints were relatively constant early in limb support, but decreased rapidly during the second half of support. The gear ratio at the hip exerted an extensor moment initially, but decreased throughout limb support and became negative midway through support. This pattern of decreasing gear ratio during the second half of support indicates that dynamic gearing does not maximize muscle power or efficiency at the elbow, wrist, hip and ankle joints. In contrast, the extensor muscles of the shoulder and knee joints exhibited an increase in gear ratio during limb support. In two dogs, the vastus lateralis muscle shortened at a relatively constant rate of 3.7–4 lengths s−1 during intermediate-speed galloping. This pattern of increasing gear ratio and constant velocity of muscle shortening at the knee joint is consistent with the hypothesis of dynamic gearing. Given the amount of work done at the knee and shoulder joints of running dogs, dynamic gearing may contribute to the economy of constant-speed running and may be important to integrated limb function.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling and computer simulation play an increasingly important role in the search for answers to questions that cannot be addressed experimentally. One of the biggest challenges in forward simulation of the movements of the musculoskeletal system is finding an optimal control strategy. It is not uncommon for this type of optimization problem that the segment dynamics need to be calculated millions of times. In addition, these calculations typically consume a large part of the CPU time during forward movement simulations. As numerous human movements are two-dimensional (2-D) to a reasonable approximation, it is extremely convenient to have a dedicated, computational efficient method for 2-D movements. In this paper we shall present such a method. The main goal is to show that a systematic approach can be adopted which allows for both automatic formulation and solution of the equations of kinematics and dynamics, and to provide some fundamental insight in the mechanical theory behind forward dynamics problems in general. To illustrate matters, we provide for download an example implementation of the main segment dynamics algorithm, as well as a complete implementation of a model of human sprint cycling.},

  abstract = {The work done during each step to lift and to reaccelerate (in the forward direction) and center of mass has been measured during locomotion in bipeds (rhea and turkey), quadrupeds (dogs, stump-tailed macaques, and ram), and hoppers (kangaroo and springhare). Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70\% of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30\% to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic “bounce” of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

  abstract = {A long-lasting challenge in comparative physiology is to understand why the efficiency of the mechanical work done to maintain locomotion increases with body mass. It has been suggested that this is due to a more elastic step in larger animals. Here we show that in running, hopping trotting animals and in human running during growth the resonant frequency of the bouncing system decreases with increasing body mass with the same trend surprisingly independent of different animal species and gaits. Step frequency about equals the resonant frequency in trotting and running whereas it is about half the resonant frequency in hopping. The energy loss by elastic hysteresis during loading-unloading the bouncing system from its equilibrium position decreases with increasing body mass. Similarity to a symmetric bounce increases with increasing body mass and, for a given body mass, seems to be maximal in hopping, intermediate in trotting and minimal in running. We conclude that: i) tuning step frequency to the resonant frequency of the bouncing system coincides with a lower hysteresis loss in larger more compliant animals, ii) the mechanism of gait per se affects similarity with a symmetric bounce independent of hysteresis and iii) the greater efficiency in larger animals may be due, at least in part, to a lower hysteresis loss.},

  abstract = {Flamingos (Phoenicopteridae) often stand and sleep on one leg for long periods, but it is unknown how much active muscle contractile force they use for the mechanical demands of standing on one leg: body weight support and maintaining balance. First, we demonstrated that flamingo cadavers could passively support body weight on one leg without               any               muscle activity while adopting a stable, unchanging, joint posture resembling that seen in live flamingos. By contrast, the cadaveric flamingo could not be stably held in a two-legged pose, suggesting a greater necessity for active muscle force to stabilize two-legged versus one-legged postures. Our results suggest that flamingos engage a passively engaged gravitational stay apparatus (proximally located) for weight support during one-legged standing. Second, we discovered that live flamingos standing on one leg have markedly reduced body sway during quiescent versus alert behaviours, with the point of force application directly under the distal joint, reducing the need for muscular joint torque. Taken together, our results highlight the possibility that flamingos stand for long durations on one leg without exacting high muscular forces and, thus, with little energetic expenditure.},

Birds morph their wing planform parameters simultaneously—including sweep, span, and area—in a way that has proven to be particularly challenging to embody robotically. Previous solutions have primarily centered around the classical aerospace paradigm of controlling every degree of freedom to ensure predictable performance, but underperform compared with birds. To understand how birds accomplish wing morphing, we measured the kinematics of wing flexion and extension in common pigeons,               Columba livia               . The skeletal and feather kinematics show that the 20 primary and 20 secondary feathers are coordinated via approximately linear transfer functions controlled by wrist and finger motion. To replicate this control principle in a robot, we developed a biohybrid morphing wing with real feathers to understand the underlying design principles. The outcome, PigeonBot, embodies 42 degrees of freedom that control the position of 40 elastically connected feathers via four servo-actuated wrist and finger joints. Our flight tests demonstrate that the soft feathered wings morph rapidly and robustly under aerodynamic loading. They not only enable wing morphing but also make robot interactions safer, the wing more robust to crashing, and the wing reparable via “preening.” In flight tests, we found that both asymmetric wrist and finger motion can initiate turn maneuvers—evidence that birds may use their fingers to steer in flight.},

Muscle force generating capacity, tendon stiffness, elastic energy storage capacity and efficiency were calculated from muscle and tendon morphological parameters and in-vitro tendon mechanical properties, obtained from a growth series of ostrich cadavers. Ontogenetic scaling relationships were established using reduced major axis regression analysis. Ostrich pelvic limb muscle mass and cross-sectional area broadly scaled with positive allometry, indicating maintained or relatively greater capacity for maximum isometric force generation in bigger animals. The length of distal limb tendons was found to scale with positive allometry in several tendons associated with antigravity support and elastic energy storage during locomotion. Distal limb tendon stiffness scaled with negative allometry with respect to body mass, with tendons being relatively more compliant in larger birds. Tendon material properties also appeared to be size-dependent, suggesting the relative increased compliance of tendons in larger ostriches is due in part to compensatory distortions in tendon material properties during maturation and development, not simply from ontogenetic changes in tendon geometry. Our results suggest that the previously reported increase in locomotor economy through ontogeny in the ostrich is likely due to greater potential for elastic energy storage with increasing body size. In fact, the rate of this increase may be somewhat greater than the conservative predictions of previous studies thus illustrating the biological importance of elastic tendon structures in adult ostriches.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The size and arrangement of fibres play a determinate role in the kinetic and energetic performance of muscles. Extrapolations between fibre architecture and performance underpin our understanding of how muscles function and how they are adapted to power specific motions within and across species. Here we provide a synopsis of how this ‘fibre to function’ paradigm has been applied to understand muscle design, performance and adaptation in animals. Our review highlights the widespread application of the fibre to function paradigm across a diverse breadth of biological disciplines but also reveals a potential and highly prevalent limitation running through past studies. Specifically, we find that quantification of muscle architectural properties is almost universally based on an extremely small number of fibre measurements. Despite the volume of research into muscle properties, across a diverse breadth of research disciplines, the fundamental assumption that a small proportion of fibre measurements can accurately represent the architectural properties of a muscle has never been quantitatively tested. Subsequently, we use a combination of medical imaging, statistical analysis, and physics‐based computer simulation to address this issue for the first time. By combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and deterministic fibre tractography we generated a large number of fibre measurements ({$>$}3000) rapidly for individual human lower limb muscles. Through statistical subsampling simulations of these measurements, we demonstrate that analysing a small number of fibres (               n               ~{$<$}\,25) typically used in previous studies may lead to extremely large errors in the characterisation of overall muscle architectural properties such as mean fibre length and physiological cross‐sectional area. Through dynamic musculoskeletal simulations of human walking and jumping, we demonstrate that recovered errors in fibre architecture characterisation have significant implications for quantitative predictions of               in‐vivo               dynamics and muscle fibre function within a species. Furthermore, by applying data‐subsampling simulations to comparisons of muscle function in humans and chimpanzees, we demonstrate that error magnitudes significantly impact both qualitative and quantitative assessment of muscle specialisation, potentially generating highly erroneous conclusions about the absolute and relative adaption of muscles across species and evolutionary transitions. Our findings have profound implications for how a broad diversity of research fields quantify muscle architecture and interpret muscle function.},

  abstract = {Introduction:               The accuracy of musculoskeletal models and simulations as methods for predicting muscle functional outputs is always improving. However, even the most complex models contain various assumptions and simplifications in how muscle force generation is simulated. One common example is the application of a generalised (“generic”) force-velocity relationship, derived from a limited data set to each muscle within a model, uniformly across all muscles irrespective of whether those muscles have “fast” or “slow” contractile properties.                                         Methods:               Using a previously built and validated musculoskeletal model and simulation of trotting in the mouse hindlimb, this work examines the predicted functional impact of applying muscle-specific force-velocity properties to typically fast (extensor digitorum longus; EDL) and slow-contracting (soleus; SOL) muscles.                                         Results:               Using “real” data led to EDL producing more positive work and acting significantly more spring-like, and soleus producing more negative work and acting more brake-like in function compared to muscles modelled using “generic” force-velocity data. Extrapolating these force-velocity properties to other muscles considered “fast” or “slow” also substantially impacted their predicted function. Importantly, this also further impacted EDL and SOL function beyond that seen when changing only their properties alone, to a point where they show an improved match to               ex vivo               experimental data.                                         Discussion:               These data suggest that further improvements to how musculoskeletal models and simulations predict muscle function should include the use of different values defining their force-velocity relationship depending on their fibre-type composition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Musculoskeletal modelling has become a valuable tool with which to understand how neural, muscular, skeletal and other tissues are integrated to produce movement. Most musculoskeletal modelling work has to date focused on humans or their close relatives, with few examples of quadrupedal animal limb models. A musculoskeletal model of the mouse hindlimb could have broad utility for questions in medicine, genetics, locomotion and neuroscience. This is due to this species’ position as a premier model of human disease, having an array of genetic tools for manipulation of the animal               in~vivo               , and being a small quadruped, a category for which few models exist. Here, the methods used to develop the first three‐dimensional (3D) model of a mouse hindlimb and pelvis are described. The model, which represents bones, joints and 39 musculotendon units, was created through a combination of previously gathered muscle architecture data from microdissections, contrast‐enhanced micro‐computed tomography (               CT               ) scanning and digital segmentation. The model allowed muscle moment arms as well as muscle forces to be estimated for each musculotendon unit throughout a range of joint rotations. Moment arm analysis supported the reliability of musculotendon unit placement within the model, and comparison to a previously published rat hindlimb model further supported the model's reliability. A sensitivity analysis performed on both the force‐generating parameters and muscle's attachment points of the model indicated that the maximal isometric muscle moment is generally most sensitive to changes in either tendon slack length or the coordinates of insertion, although the degree to which the moment is affected depends on several factors. This model represents the first step in the creation of a fully dynamic 3D computer model of the mouse hindlimb and pelvis that has application to neuromuscular disease, comparative biomechanics and the neuromechanical basis of movement. Capturing the morphology and dynamics of the limb, it enables future dissection of the complex interactions between the nervous and musculoskeletal systems as well as the environment.},

  abstract = {Musculoskeletal modelling is an important platform on which to study the biomechanics of morphological structures in vertebrates and is widely used in clinical, zoological and palaeontological fields. The popularity of this approach stems from the potential to non-invasively quantify biologically important but difficult-to-measure functional parameters. However, while it is known that model predictions are highly sensitive to input values, it is standard practice to build models by combining musculoskeletal data from different sources resulting in ‘generic’ models for a given species. At present, there are little quantitative data on how merging disparate anatomical data in models impacts the accuracy of these functional predictions. This issue is addressed herein by quantifying the accuracy of both subject-specific human limb models containing individualised muscle force-generating properties and models built using generic properties from both elderly and young individuals, relative to experimental muscle torques obtained from an isokinetic dynamometer. The results show that subject-specific models predict isokinetic muscle torques to a greater degree of accuracy than generic models at the ankle (root-mean-squared error – 7.9\% vs. 49.3\% in elderly anatomy-based models), knee (13.2\% vs. 57.3\%) and hip (21.9\% vs. 32.8\%). These results have important implications for the choice of musculoskeletal properties in future modelling studies, and the relatively high level of accuracy achieved in the subject-specific models suggests that such models can potentially address questions about inter-subject variations of muscle functions. However, despite relatively high levels of overall accuracy, models built using averaged generic muscle architecture data from young, healthy individuals may lack the resolution and accuracy required to study such differences between individuals, at least in certain circumstances. The results do not wholly discourage the continued use of averaged generic data in musculoskeletal modelling studies but do emphasise the need for to maximise the accuracy of input values if studying intra-species form–function relationships in the musculoskeletal system.},

Despite their importance, in vivo sarcomere lengths remain unknown for many human muscles. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microendoscopy is a minimally invasive technique for imaging sarcomeres in vivo and measuring their lengths. In this study, we used SHG microendoscopy to visualize sarcomeres of the human vastus lateralis, a large knee extensor muscle important for mobility, to examine how sarcomere lengths change with knee flexion and thus affect the muscle’s force-generating capacity. We acquired in vivo sarcomere images of several muscle fibers of the resting vastus lateralis in six healthy individuals. Mean sarcomere lengths increased (p = 0.031) from 2.84±0.16 μm at 50° of knee flexion to 3.17±0.13 μm at 110° of knee flexion. The standard deviation of sarcomere lengths among different fibers within a muscle was 0.21±0.09 μm. Our results suggest that the sarcomeres of the resting vastus lateralis at 50° of knee flexion are near optimal length. At a knee flexion angle of 110° the resting sarcomeres of vastus lateralis are longer than optimal length. These results show a smaller sarcomere length change and greater conservation of force-generating capacity with knee flexion than estimated in previous studies.},

We show that GAs designed in accordance with classic visual design principles significantly enhance readers’ first impressions of a paper. Well-designed GAs make papers seem more interesting, more clearly written and more scientifically rigorous. These results confirm that visual design enhances rather than detracts from the perception of intellectual and scientific competence.},

To determine the mechanical energy trade-offs of their bimodal locomotion, we rewarded four Pacific parrotlets with a seed for flying voluntarily between instrumented perches inside a new aerodynamic force platform. By integrating direct measurements of both leg and wing forces with kinematics in a bimodal long jump and flight model, we discovered that parrotlets direct their leg impulse to minimize the mechanical energy needed to forage over different distances and inclinations. The bimodal locomotion model further shows how even a small lift contribution from a single proto-wingbeat would have significantly lengthened the long jump of foraging arboreal dinosaurs. These avian bimodal locomotion strategies can also help robots traverse cluttered environments more effectively.},

  abstract = {In most mammals, footpads are what first strike ground with each stride. Their mechanical properties therefore inevitably affect functioning of the legs; yet interspecific studies of the scaling of locomotor mechanics have all but neglected the feet and their soft tissues. Here we determine how contact area and stiffness of footpads in digitigrade carnivorans scale with body mass in order to show how footpads’ mechanical properties and size covary to maintain their functional integrity. As body mass increases across several orders of magnitude, we find the following: (i) foot contact area does not keep pace with increasing body mass; therefore pressure increases, placing footpad tissue of larger animals potentially at greater risk of damage; (ii) but stiffness of the pads also increases, so the tissues of larger animals must experience less strain; and (iii) total energy stored in hindpads increases slightly more than that in the forepads, allowing additional elastic energy to be returned for greater propulsive efficiency. Moreover, pad stiffness appears to be tuned across the size range to maintain loading regimes in the limbs that are favourable for long-bone remodelling. Thus, the structural properties of footpads, unlike other biological support-structures, scale interspecifically through changes in both geometry and material properties, rather than geometric proportions alone, and do so with consequences for both maintenance and operation of other components of the locomotor system.},

In a detailed analysis of limb movements in walking Asian elephants and giraffes, however, distinct differences between actual limb movements and the predicted limb movements using only gravity as driving force were observed. Additionally, stride frequency was highly variable. Swing time was fairly constant, but especially at high walking speeds, much shorter than half the natural pendulum period. An analysis of hip and shoulder movements during walking showed that limb swinging was influenced by accelerations of hip and shoulder joints especially at high walking speeds. These results suggest an economical fast walking mechanism that could have been utilised by large dinosaurs to increase maximum speeds of locomotion. These findings throw new light on the dynamics of large vertebrates and can be used to improve speed estimates in large dinosaurs. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Geschwindigkeiten gehender Dinosaurier, die fossile Fährten hinterlassen haben, wurden als Produkt aus Schrittlänge und natürlicher Pendelfrequenz der Beine abgeschätzt. Eine detaillierte Analyse der Beinbewegungen von gehenden Asiatischen Elefanten und Giraffen offenbarte allerdings klare Unterschiede zwischen den tatsächlichen Extremitätenbewegungen und den Bewegungen, die zu erwarten wären, wenn die Gravitation die einzige treibende Kraft darstellte. Zudem erwies sich die Schrittfrequenz als hochgradig variabel. Die Schwingzeit der Gliedmaßen war recht konstant, aber besonders bei hohen Gehgeschwindigkeiten viel kürzer als die halbe natürliche Pendelperiode der Extremitäten. Eine Analyse der Bewegungen der Hüft- und Schultergelenke während des Gehens zeigte, daß das Schwingen der Gliedmaßen durch Beschleunigungen dieser Gelenke beeinflußt wurde, insbesondere bei hohen Gehgeschwindigkeiten. Die Resultate legen einen ökonomischen Mechanismus für schnelles Gehen nahe, der von großen Dinosauriern zur Erhöhung der Höchstgeschwindigkeiten eingesetzt worden sein könnte.

Small to medium sized theropods have strength indicator values comparable to fast-moving ungulates and carnivorans, whereas all large genera have considerably lower strength indicator values, roughly comparable to elephants and hippopotamuses. This suggests that their locomotory potential was reduced compared to the smaller forms. Limb bone ratios of a large number of extant mammals clearly differentiate fast-moving forms, classified from their anatomy as subcursorial or cursorial, from forms capable of less rapid locomotion, classified as graviportal and mediportal. Limb bone ratios for theropods, however, somewhat contradict the above, as all theropods group among subcursorial mammals. Calculations on estimated peak locomotory performance indicates that even large theropods could have been fast moving without having to include a suspended phase in the stride, thus not subjecting their appendicular anatomy to large amounts of stress, due to their very long limbs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Bipedalism has repeatedly evolved in many independent lineages throughout tetrapod history. Despite being widespread, the fundamental biomechanical factors involved in bipedalism remain unclear. This study experimentally investigated bipedalism in facultatively bipedal lizards and obligatorily bipedal birds to explore temporal asymmetry in the vertical component of the ground reaction force (               F               z               ). Both lizards and birds showed significant temporal asymmetry – with higher vertical forces exerted earlier in the stance – as indicated by three different measures computed from force‐time profiles. This result parallels those reported previously for other bipedal animal groups that have a forward situated whole‐body centre of mass (               COM               ), such as kangaroos and non‐human primates. Humans, in contrast, exhibit an orthograde posture with the               COM               close the hips, and show little temporal asymmetry in               F               z               , particularly during walking. Across a wide range of quadrupedal animals, temporal asymmetry is quite variable. Collectively, these results suggest that an ‘early‐skewed’               F               z               may be an important feature of steady bipedal locomotion when the               COM               is forward of the hips, although an exact mechanism of cause‐and‐effect, if one exists, remains to be established. This finding has relevance for attempts at better understanding bipedal locomotion in extinct animals that likely had a               COM               located forward of the hips, such as carnivorous dinosaurs.},

Convex hulling, where the smallest-possible convex object that surrounds a set of points is calculated, has been suggested as an effective and time-efficient method to estimate these parameters in extinct animals, where soft tissues are rarely preserved. We investigated the effectiveness of convex hull BSP estimation in a range of extant mammals, to inform the potential future usage of this technique with extinct taxa. Computed tomography scans of both the skeleton and skin of every species investigated were virtually segmented. BSPs (the mass, position of the centre of mass and inertial tensors of each segment) were calculated from the resultant soft tissue segments, while the bone segments were used as the basis for convex hull reconstructions. We performed phylogenetic generalized least squares and ordinary least squares regressions to compare the BSPs calculated from soft tissue segments with those estimated using convex hulls, finding consistent predictive relationships for each body segment. The resultant regression equations can, therefore, be used with confidence in future volumetric reconstruction and biomechanical analyses of mammals, in both extinct and extant species where such data may not be available.},

In skeletal muscle, talin 1 regulates the stability of myotendinous junctions (MTJs), but the function of talin 2 in skeletal muscle is not known. Here we show that MTJ integrity is affected in talin 2-deficient mice. Concomitant ablation of talin 1 and 2 leads to defects in myoblast fusion and sarcomere assembly, resembling defects in muscle lacking beta1 integrins. Talin 1/2-deficient myoblasts express functionally active beta1 integrins, suggesting that defects in muscle development are not primarily caused by defects in ligand binding, but rather by disruptions of the interaction of integrins with the cytoskeleton. Consistent with this finding, assembly of integrin adhesion complexes is perturbed in the remaining muscle fibers of talin 1/2-deficient mice. We conclude that talin 1 and 2 are crucial for skeletal muscle development, where they regulate myoblast fusion, sarcomere assembly and the maintenance of MTJs.},

Eighteen 16-week-old Wistar rats were used and divided into three groups of 6 animals each: a) the left soleus muscle was immobilized in the shortened position for 3 weeks; b) during immobilization, the soleus was stretched for 40 min every 3 days; c) the non-immobilized soleus was only stretched. Left and right soleus muscles were examined. One portion of the soleus was frozen for histology and muscle fiber area evaluation, while the other portion was used to identify the number and length of serial sarcomeres. Immobilized muscles (group A) showed a significant decrease in weight (44 +/- 6\%), length (19 +/- 7\%), serial sarcomere number (23 +/- 15\%), and fiber area (37 +/- 31\%) compared to the contralateral muscles (P {$<$} 0.05, paired Student t-test). The immobilized and stretched soleus (group B) showed a similar reduction but milder muscle fiber atrophy compared to the only immobilized group (22 +/- 40 vs 37 +/- 31\%, respectively; P {$<$} 0.001, ANOVA test). Muscles submitted only to stretching (group C) significantly increased the length (5 +/- 2\%), serial sarcomere number (4 +/- 4\%), and fiber area (16 +/- 44\%) compared to the contralateral muscles (P {$<$} 0.05, paired Student t-test). In conclusion, stretching applied every 3 days to immobilized muscles did not prevent the muscle shortening, but reduced muscle atrophy. Stretching sessions induced hypertrophic effects in the control muscles. These results support the use of muscle stretching in sports and rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             A muscle’s performance is influenced by where it operates on its force–length (F–L) curve. Here we explore how activation and tendon compliance interact to influence muscle operating lengths and force-generating capacity. To study this, we built a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb of the guinea fowl and simulated the F–L operating range during fixed-end fixed-posture contractions for 39 actuators under thousands of combinations of activation and posture using three different muscle models: Muscles with non-compliant tendons, muscles with compliant tendons but no activation-dependent shift in optimal fiber length (L0), and muscles with both compliant tendons and activation-dependent shifts in L0. We found that activation-dependent effects altered muscle fiber lengths up to 40\% and increased or decreased force capacity by up to 50\% during fixed-end contractions. Typically, activation-compliance effects reduce muscle force and are dominated by the effects of tendon compliance at high activations. At low activation, however, activation-dependent shifts in L0 are equally important and can result in relative force changes for low compliance muscles of up to 60\%. There are regions of the F–L curve in which muscles are most sensitive to compliance and there are troughs of influence where these factors have little effect. These regions are hard to predict, though, because the magnitude and location of these areas of high and low sensitivity shift with compliance level. In this study we provide a map for when these effects will meaningfully influence force capacity and an example of their contributions to force production during a static task, namely standing.},

  abstract = {A pendulum test with a whole articular joint serving as the fulcrum is commonly used to measure the bulk coefficient of friction (COF). In such tests it is universally assumed that energy loss is due to frictional damping only, and accordingly the decay of pendulum amplitude is linear with time. The purpose of this work was to determine whether the measurement of the COF is improved when viscous damping and exponential decay of pendulum amplitude are incorporated into a lumped-parameter model.             Various pendulum models with a range of values for COF and for viscous damping were constructed. The resulting decay was fitted with an exponential function (including both frictional and viscous damping) and with a linear decay function (frictional damping only). The values predicted from the fit of each function were then compared to the known values.             It was found that the exponential decay function was able to predict the COF values within 2 per cent error. This error increased for models in which the damping coefficient was relatively small and the COF was relatively large. On the other hand, the linear decay function resulted in large errors in the prediction of the COF, even for small values of viscous damping. The exponential decay function including both frictional and constant viscous damping presented herein dramatically increased the accuracy of measuring the COF in a pendulum test of modelled whole articular joints.},

  abstract = {The body fossil record cannot preserve the dynamics of animal locomotion, and the only way to systematically reconstruct it is through simulation. However, musculoskeletal models used in simulation studies are typically simplified, meaning that their efficacy must first be demonstrated on living animals. Here, we evaluate a workflow for forward-dynamics simulations of maximum-effort vertical jumping, using simplified human and guineafowl models built with muscle masses from either measured data or estimated with methods previously applied to fossils. Predicted human performance was approximately 10\% below experimental averages when known muscle masses were used, while the error ranged between +3 and −10\% with palaeobiological methods. The simulations also correctly replicated the kinematic strategies (countermovement or squat jump) used across different starting postures. In contrast, predicted guineafowl performance was around 50–60\% experimental values, irrespective of reconstruction method. Guineafowl model underperformance likely reflects simplifications related to foot mobility, muscle activation speeds and muscle fibre lengths, with the latter potentially being adaptively important to exceptional avian jumping performance. These findings emphasize that current muscle reconstruction and simulation approaches are most suited for evolutionary analyses where broad changes in body morphology and posture may significantly impact vertical jumping through pronounced qualitative differences in kinematic strategy.},

  abstract = {AbstractIn vertebrates, active movement is driven by muscle forces acting on bones, either directly or through tendinous insertions. There has been much debate over how muscle size and force are reflected by the muscular attachment areas (AAs). Here we investigate the relationship between the physiological cross‐sectional area (PCSA), a proxy for the force production of the muscle, and the AA of hindlimb muscles in Nile crocodiles and five bird species. The limbs were held in a fixed position whilst blunt dissection was carried out to isolate the individual muscles. AAs were digitised using a point digitiser, before the muscle was removed from the bone. Muscles were then further dissected and fibre architecture was measured, and PCSA calculated. The raw measures, as well as the ratio of PCSA to AA, were studied and compared for intra‐observer error as well as intra‐ and interspecies differences. We found large variations in the ratio between AAs and PCSA both within and across species, but muscle fascicle lengths are conserved within individual species, whether this was Nile crocodiles or tinamou. Whilst a discriminant analysis was able to separate crocodylian and avian muscle data, the ratios for AA to cross‐sectional area for all species and most muscles can be represented by a single equation. The remaining muscles have specific equations to represent their scaling, but equations often have a relatively high success at predicting the ratio of muscle AA to PCSA. We then digitised the muscle AAs of Coelophysis bauri, a dinosaur, to estimate the PCSAs and therefore maximal isometric muscle forces. The results are somewhat consistent with other methods for estimating force production, and suggest that, at least for some archosaurian muscles, that it is possible to use muscle AA to estimate muscle sizes. This method is complementary to other methods such as digital volumetric modelling.},

Ex-vivo               strains were collected from the cranial bone and rhamphotheca. These experimental strains were then compared to convergence tested, specimen-specific finite element (FE) models. The FE models contained segmented cortical and trabecular bone, sutures and the keratinous rhamphotheca as identified from micro-CT scan data. Each of these individual materials was assigned isotropic material properties either from the literature or from nanoindentation, and the FE models compared to the               ex-vivo               results. The FE models generally replicate the location of peak strains and reflect the correct mode of deformation in the rostral region. The models are too stiff in regions of experimentally recorded high strain and too elastic in regions of low experimentally recorded low strain. The mode of deformation in the low strain neurocranial region is not replicated by the FE models, and although the models replicate strain orientations to within 10° in some regions, in most regions the correlation is not strong. Cranial sutures, as has previously been found in other taxa, are important for modifying both strain magnitude and strain patterns across the entire skull, but especially between opposing the sutural junctions. Experimentally, we find that the strains on the surface of the rhamphotheca are much lower than those found on nearby bone. The FE models produce much higher principal strains despite similar strain ratios across the entirety of the rhamphotheca. This study emphasises the importance of attempting to validate FE models, modelling sutures and rhamphothecae in birds, and shows that whilst location of peak strain and patterns of deformation can be modelled, replicating experimental data in digital models of avian crania remains problematic.},

Do muscles differ in their ability to modulate force-length contractile function to meet the mechanical demands of different locomotor tasks? We explore this question by examining the in vivoforce-length performance of the guinea fowl Numida meleagris lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and digital flexor-IV (DF-IV), during level and incline locomotion. During level locomotion, the LG and DF-IV exhibit differing muscle fascicle strain patterns: the LG shortens by 10-15\% while developing force,whereas the DF-IV undergoes a stretch-shorten cycle with large strain amplitudes and small net strains of 1-8\%. Furthermore, the DF-IV operates at higher muscle stresses (92-130 kPa, compared to 23-39 kPa for LG) and possesses a longer tendon, which allows the DF-IV tendon to recover greater elastic energy than the LG tendon. During incline locomotion, these muscles contribute only one-third of the energy expected for their mass, with the DF-IV exhibiting high stride-to-stride variability in work output. While the stretch-shorten cycle of the DF-IV muscle may allow more economic force production, it also leads to large changes in work output with small changes in the relative timing of force and strain. Thus, while the primary determinants of LG work are net strain and mean force, the primary determinant of DF-IV work is the phase relationship between force and strain. Our results suggest that, in addition to influencing a muscle's mechanical performance during steady level locomotion, morphology also affects its capacity and mechanism for altering work output for different locomotor tasks.},

  abstract = {Birds provide an interesting opportunity to study the relationships between body size, limb morphology and bipedal locomotor function. Birds are ecologically diverse and span a large range of body size and limb proportions, yet all use their hindlimbs for bipedal terrestrial locomotion, for at least some part of their life history. Here, we review the scaling of avian striding bipedal gaits to explore how body mass and leg morphology influence walking and running. We collate literature data from 21 species, spanning a 2500× range in body mass from painted quail to ostriches. Using dynamic similarity theory to interpret scaling trends, we find evidence for independent effects of body mass, leg length and leg posture on gait. We find no evidence for scaling of duty factor with body size, suggesting that vertical forces scale with dynamic similarity. However, at dynamically similar speeds, large birds use relatively shorter stride lengths and higher stride frequencies compared with small birds. We also find that birds with long legs for their mass, such as the white stork and red-legged seriema, use longer strides and lower swing frequencies, consistent with the influence of high limb inertia on gait. We discuss the observed scaling of avian bipedal gait in relation to mechanical demands for force, work and power relative to muscle actuator capacity, muscle activation costs related to leg cycling frequency, and considerations of stability and agility. Many opportunities remain for future work to investigate how morphology influences gait dynamics among birds specialized for different habitats and locomotor behaviors.},

  abstract = {Economy is a central principle for understanding animal locomotion. Yet, compared with theoretical predictions concerning economy, animals run with compliant legs that are energetically costly. Here, we address this apparent paradox, highlighting two factors that predict benefits for compliant gaits: (i) minimizing cost of work associated with bouncing viscera; and (ii) leg control for robust stability in uneven terrain. We show that consideration of the effects of bouncing viscera predicts an energetic optimum for relatively compliant legs. To compare stability in uneven terrain, we introduce the normalized maximum drop (NMD), a measure based on simple kinematics, which predicts that compliant legs allow negotiation of relatively larger terrain perturbations without failure. Our model also suggests an inherent trade-off in control of leg retraction velocity (               ω               ) for stability: low               ω               allows higher NMD, reducing fall risk, whereas high               ω               minimizes peak forces with terrain drops, reducing injury risk. Optimization for one of these factors explicitly limits the other; however, compliant legs relax this trade-off, allowing greater stability by both measures. Our models suggest compromises in leg control for economy and stability that might explain why animals run with compliant legs.},

  abstract = {Grounded running predominantly differs from traditional aerial running by having alternating single and double stance with no flight phase. Approximately, 16\% of runners in an open marathon and 33\% of recreational runners in a 5 km running event adopted a grounded running technique. Grounded running typically occurs at a speed range of 2–3 m·s               −1               , is characterised by a larger duty factor, reduced vertical leg stiffness, lower vertical oscillation of the centre of mass (COM) and greater impact attenuation than aerial running. Grounded running typically induces an acute increase in metabolic cost, likely due to the larger duty factor. The increased duty factor may translate to a more stable locomotion. The reduced vertical oscillation of COM, attenuated impact shock, and potential for improved postural stability may make grounded running a preferred form of physical exercise in people new to running or with low loading capacities (eg, novice overweight/obese, elderly runners, rehabilitating athletes). Grounded running as a less impactful, but metabolically more challenging form, could benefit these runners to optimise their cardio-metabolic health, while at the same time minimise running-related injury risk. This review discusses the mechanical demands and energetics of grounded running along with recommendations and suggestions to implement this technique in practice.},

  abstract = {Muscles expend energy to perform active work during locomotion, but they may also expend significant energy to produce force, for example when tendons perform much of the work passively. The relative contributions of work and force to overall energy expenditure are unknown. We therefore measured the mechanics and energetics of a cyclical bouncing task, designed to control for work and force. We hypothesized that near bouncing resonance, little work would be performed actively by muscle, but the cyclical production of force would cost substantial metabolic energy. Human subjects (n = 9) bounced vertically about the ankles at inversely proportional frequencies (1-4 Hz) and amplitudes (15-4 mm), such that the overall rate of work performed on the body remained approximately constant (0.30 ± 0.06 W/kg), but the forces varied considerably. We used parameter identification to estimate series elasticity of the triceps surae tendon, as well as the work performed actively by muscle and passively by\textbackslash{} tendon. Net metabolic energy expenditure for bouncing at 1 Hz was 1.15 ± 0.31 W/kg, attributable mainly to active muscle work with an efficiency of 24 ± 3\%. But at 3 Hz (near resonance), most of the work was performed passively, so that active muscle work could account for only 40\% of the net metabolic rate of 0.76 ± 0.28 W/kg. Near resonance, a cost for cyclical force that increased with both amplitude and frequency of force accounted for at least as much of the total energy expenditure as a cost for work. Series elasticity reduces the need for active work, but energy must still be expended for force production. Copyright © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

  abstract = {The Carboniferous (358.9 to 298.9 Ma) saw the emergence of marine ecosystems dominated by modern vertebrate groups, including abundant stem-group holocephalans (chimaeras and relatives). Compared with the handful of anatomically conservative holocephalan genera alive today—demersal durophages all—these animals were astonishingly morphologically diverse, and bizarre anatomies in groups such as iniopterygians hint at specialized ecological roles foreshadowing those of the later, suction-feeding neopterygians. However, flattened fossils usually obscure these animals’ functional morphologies and how they fitted into these important early ecosystems. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) methods to show that the musculoskeletal anatomy of the uniquely 3D-preserved iniopterygian               Iniopera               can be best interpreted as being similar to that of living holocephalans rather than elasmobranchs but that it was mechanically unsuited to durophagy. Rather,               Iniopera               had a small, anteriorly oriented mouth aperture, expandable pharynx, and strong muscular links among the pectoral girdle, neurocranium, and ventral pharynx consistent with high-performance suction feeding, something exhibited by no living holocephalan and never clearly characterized in any of the extinct members of the holocephalan stem-group. Remarkably, in adapting a distinctly holocephalan anatomy to suction feeding,               Iniopera               is more comparable to modern tetrapod suction feeders than to the more closely related high-performance suction-feeding elasmobranchs. This raises questions about the assumed role of durophagy in the evolution of holocephalans’ distinctive anatomy and offers a rare glimpse into the breadth of ecological niches filled by holocephalans in a pre-neopterygian world.},

  abstract = {Limb length, cursoriality and speed have long been areas of significant interest in theropod paleobiology as locomotory capacity, especially running ability, is critical in not just in prey pursuit but also to avoid become prey oneself. One aspect that is traditionally overlooked is the impact of allometry on running ability and the limiting effect of large body size. Since several different non-avian theropod lineages have each independently evolved body sizes greater than any known terrestrial carnivorous mammal, \{\textbackslash textasciitilde\}1000kg or more, the effect that such larger mass has on movement ability and energetics is an area with significant implications for Mesozoic paleoecology. Here using expansive datasets, incorporating several different metrics to estimate body size, limb length and running speed, to calculate the effects of allometry running We test both on traditional metrics used to evaluate cursoriality in non-avian theropods such as distal limb length, relative hindlimb length as well as comparing the energetic cost savings of relative hindlimb elongation between members of the Tyrannosauridae and more basal megacarnivores such as Allosauroids or Ceratosauridae. We find that once the limiting effects of body size increase is incorporated, no commonly used metric including the newly suggested distal limb index (Tibia + Metatarsus/ Femur length) shows a significant correlation to top speed. The data also shows a significant split between large and small bodied theropods in terms of maximizing running potential suggesting two distinct strategies for promoting limb elongation based on the organisms\{'\} size. For small and medium sized theropods increased leg length seems to correlate with a desire to increase top speed while amongst larger taxa it corresponds more closely to energetic efficiency and reducing foraging costs. We also find, using 3D volumetric mass estimates, that the Tyrannosauridae show significant cost of transport savings compared to more basal clades, indicating reduced energy expenditures during foraging and likely reduced need for hunting forays. This suggests that amongst theropods while no one strategy dictated hindlimb evolution. Amongst smaller bodied taxa the competing pressures of being both a predator and a prey item dominant while larger ones, freed from predation pressure, seek to maximize foraging ability. We also discuss the implications both for interactions amongst specific clades and Mesozoic paleobiology and paleoecological reconstructions as a whole},

  abstract = {Estimation of muscle forces during motion involves solving an indeterminate problem (more unknown muscle forces than joint moment constraints), frequently via optimization methods. When the dynamics of muscle activation and contraction are modeled for consistency with muscle physiology, the resulting optimization problem is dynamic and challenging to solve. This study sought to identify a robust and computationally efficient formulation for solving these dynamic optimization problems using direct collocation optimal control methods. Four problem formulations were investigated for walking based on both a two and three dimensional model. Formulations differed in the use of either an explicit or implicit representation of contraction dynamics with either muscle length or tendon force as a state variable. The implicit representations introduced additional controls defined as the time derivatives of the states, allowing the nonlinear equations describing contraction dynamics to be imposed as algebraic path constraints, simplifying their evaluation. Problem formulation affected computational speed and robustness to the initial guess. The formulation that used explicit contraction dynamics with muscle length as a state failed to converge in most cases. In contrast, the two formulations that used implicit contraction dynamics converged to an optimal solution in all cases for all initial guesses, with tendon force as a state generally being the fastest. Future work should focus on comparing the present approach to other approaches for computing muscle forces. The present approach lacks some of the major limitations of established methods such as static optimization and computed muscle control while remaining computationally efficient.},

We investigated the effects of an intermittent stretch training on muscle biomechanical and structural variables. The left plantarflexors muscles of seven anesthetized New Zealand (NZ) White rabbits were passively and statically stretched three times a week for 4 wk, while the corresponding right muscles were used as nonstretched contralat- eral controls. Before and after the stretching protocol, passive torque produced by the left plantarflexor muscles as a function of the ankle angle was measured. The left and right plantarflexor muscles were harvested from dead rabbits and used to quantify possible changes in muscle structure. Significant mass and serial sarcomere number in- creases were observed in the stretched soleus but not in the plantaris or medial gastrocnemius. This difference in adaptation between the plantarflexors is thought to be the result of their different fiber type composition and pennation angles. Neither titin isoform nor collagen amount was modified in the stretched compared with the control soleus muscle. Passive torque developed during ankle dorsiflexion was not modified after the stretch training on average, but was decreased in five of the seven experimental rabbits. Thus, an inter- mittent stretching program similar to those used in humans can produce a change in the muscle structure of NZ White rabbits, which was associated in some rabbits with a change in the biomechanical properties of the muscle-tendon unit. sarcomerogenesis;}

Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation but requires extensive technical expertise to implement. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves, allowing them to focus on their scientific questions.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Diversity in the body shapes and sizes of dinosaurs was foundational to their widespread success during the Mesozoic era. The ability to quantify body size and form reliably is therefore critical to the study of dinosaur biology and evolution. Body mass estimates for any given fossil animal are, in theory, most informative when derived from volumetric models that account for the three‐dimensional shapes of the entire body. In addition to providing estimates of total body mass, volumetric approaches can be used to determine the inertial properties of specific body segments and the overall distribution of mass throughout the body, each of which are essential for the modelling and interpretation of form–function relationships and their associations with ecology. However, the determination of body volumes in fossil taxa is often subjective, and may be sensitive to varied artistic inference. This highlights the need for an approach to body mass estimation in which body segment volumes are systematically constrained by quantitative scaling relationships between the hard tissues that fossilise and the soft tissues only observable in extant taxa. To this end, we used recently published skeletal to soft tissue volumetric scaling factors derived from CT data of extant sauropsids to estimate body segment mass properties from skeletal models of 52 non‐avian dinosaurs representing the majority of major clades and body plans. The body masses estimated by this study range from less than 200\,g in the tiny avialan               Yixianornis               to over 60 tonnes in the giant sauropod               Patagotitan               , which is currently the largest dinosaur known from mostly complete skeletal remains. From our models, we infer that many previous reconstructions of soft tissue envelopes may be too small, and that many dinosaurs were therefore heavier than previous estimates. Our models generally overlap with the range of body mass estimates derived from limb bone shaft dimensions, but with considerable quantitative variability among major clades. This suggests that different taxa either differed in skeletal to soft tissue volume ratios, or that their limb bone dimensions varied relative to body mass, perhaps related to differences in locomotor dynamics and postural evolution. Our models also allowed us to investigate variation in mass distribution and body proportions across different dinosaurs from a perspective grounded in extant anatomical data, framing long‐standing hypotheses about their form, function, and behaviour in a quantitative context. For example, reconstructed disparity in whole‐body centres of mass reflects a broad array of postures in different dinosaur clades, while the lack of strong positive allometry in the dimensions of the weight‐bearing limb segments relative to total body mass corroborates previous studies suggesting an overall decrease in dinosaur locomotor performance as body size increased.},

However, the implications of these different morphologies for specific functions are still poorly understood. Here, we present the first quantitative analysis into the locomotor abilities of a stem-archosaur applying 3D modelling techniques. μCT scans of multiple specimens of               Euparkeria capensis               enabled the reconstruction and three-dimensional articulation of the hindlimb. The joint mobility of the hindlimb was quantified in 3D to address previous qualitative hypotheses regarding the stance of               Euparkeria               . Our range of motion analysis implies the potential for an erect posture, consistent with the hip morphology, allowing the femur to be fully adducted to position the feet beneath the body. A fully sprawling pose appears unlikely but a wide range of hip abduction remained feasible—the hip appears quite mobile. The oblique mesotarsal ankle joint in               Euparkeria               implies, however, a more abducted hindlimb. This is consistent with a mosaic of ancestral and derived osteological characters in the hindlimb, and might suggest a moderately adducted posture for               Euparkeria               . Our results support a single origin of a pillar-erect hip morphology, ancestral to Eucrocopoda that preceded later development of a hinge-like ankle joint and a more erect hindlimb posture.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Biomechanical models and simulations of musculoskeletal function rely on accurate muscle parameters, such as muscle masses and lines of action, to estimate force production potential and moment arms. These parameters are often obtained through destructive techniques (i.e., dissection) in living taxa, frequently hindering the measurement of other relevant parameters from a single individual, thus making it necessary to combine multiple specimens and/or sources. Estimating these parameters in extinct taxa is even more challenging as soft tissues are rarely preserved in fossil taxa and the skeletal remains contain relatively little information about the size or exact path of a muscle. Here we describe a new protocol that facilitates the estimation of missing muscle parameters (i.e., muscle volume and path) for extant and extinct taxa. We created three-dimensional volumetric reconstructions for the hindlimb muscles of the extant Nile crocodile and extinct stem-archosaur               Euparkeria               , and the shoulder muscles of an extant gorilla to demonstrate the broad applicability of this methodology across living and extinct animal clades. Additionally, our method can be combined with surface geometry data digitally captured during dissection, thus facilitating downstream analyses. We evaluated the estimated muscle masses against physical measurements to test their accuracy in estimating missing parameters. Our estimated muscle masses generally compare favourably with segmented iodine-stained muscles and almost all fall within or close to the range of observed muscle masses, thus indicating that our estimates are reliable and the resulting lines of action calculated sufficiently accurately. This method has potential for diverse applications in evolutionary morphology and biomechanics.},

  abstract = {The unique structure of the human foot is seen as a crucial adaptation for bipedalism. The foot’s arched shape enables stiffening the foot to withstand high loads when pushing off, without compromising foot flexibility. Experimental studies demonstrated that manipulating foot stiffness has considerable effects on gait. In clinical practice, altered foot structure is associated with pathological gait. Yet, experimentally manipulating individual foot properties (e.g. arch height or tendon and ligament stiffness) is hard and therefore our understanding of how foot structure influences gait mechanics is still limited. Predictive simulations are a powerful tool to explore causal relationships between musculoskeletal properties and whole-body gait. However, musculoskeletal models used in three-dimensional predictive simulations assume a rigid foot arch, limiting their use for studying how foot structure influences three-dimensional gait mechanics. Here, we developed a four-segment foot model with a longitudinal arch for use in predictive simulations. We identified three properties of the ankle-foot complex that are important to capture ankle and knee kinematics, soleus activation, and ankle power of healthy adults: (1) compliant Achilles tendon, (2) stiff heel pad, (3) the ability to stiffen the foot. The latter requires sufficient arch height and contributions of plantar fascia, and intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles. A reduced ability to stiffen the foot results in walking patterns with reduced push-off power. Simulations based on our model also captured the effects of walking with anaesthetised intrinsic foot muscles or an insole limiting arch compression. The ability to reproduce these different experiments indicates that our foot model captures the main mechanical properties of the foot. The presented four-segment foot model is a potentially powerful tool to study the relationship between foot properties and gait mechanics and energetics in health and disease.},

  abstract = {The central nervous system of humans and other animals modulates spinal cord activity to achieve several locomotion behaviors. Previous neuromechanical models investigated the modulation of human gait changing selected parameters belonging to CPGs (Central Pattern Generators) feedforward oscillatory structures or to feedback reflex circuits. CPG-based models could replicate slow and fast walking by changing only the oscillation’s properties. On the other hand, reflex-based models could achieve different behaviors through optimizations of large dimensional parameter spaces. However, they could not effectively identify individual key reflex parameters responsible for gait characteristics’ modulation. This study investigates which reflex parameters modulate the gait characteristics through neuromechanical simulations. A recently developed reflex-based model is used to perform optimizations with different target behaviors on speed, step length, and step duration to analyze the correlation between reflex parameters and their influence on these gait characteristics. We identified nine key parameters that may affect the target speed ranging from slow to fast walking (0.48 and 1.71 m/s) as well as a large range of step lengths (0.43 and 0.88 m) and step duration (0.51, 0.98 s). The findings show that specific reflexes during stance significantly affect step length regulation, mainly given by positive force feedback of the ankle plantarflexors’ group. On the other hand, stretch reflexes active during swing of iliopsoas and gluteus maximus regulate all the gait characteristics under analysis. Additionally, the results show that the hamstrings’ group’s stretch reflex during the landing phase is responsible for modulating the step length and step duration. Additional validation studies in simulations demonstrated that the modulation of identified reflexes is sufficient to regulate the investigated gait characteristics. Thus, this study provides an overview of possible reflexes involved in modulating speed, step length, and step duration of human gaits.},

In situ hybridization identified higher levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA at the MTJ of fibers stretched for 4 d. Electron microscopy at the MTJ of these lengthening fibers revealed a large cytoplasmic space devoid of myofibrils, but containing polysomes, sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-membranes, mitochondria, Golgi complexes, and nascent filament assemblies. Tallies from electron micrographs indicate that myofibril assembly in stretched fibers followed a set sequence of events. (a) In stretched fiber ends almost the entire sarcolemmal membrane was electron dense but only a portion had attached myofibrils. Vinculin, detected by immunofluorescence, was greatly increased at the MTJ membrane of stretched muscles. (b) Thin filaments were anchored to the sarcolemma at the electron dense sites. (c) Thick filaments associated with these thin filaments in an unregistered manner. (d) Z-bodies splice into thin filaments and subsequently thin and thick filaments fall into sarcomeric register. Thus, the MTJ is a site of mRNA accumulation which sets up regional protein synthesis and myofibril assembly. Stretched muscles also lengthen by the addition of myotubes at their ends. After 6 d of stretch these myotubes make up the majority of fibers at the muscle ends. Essentially all these myotubes repeat the developmental program of primary myotubes and express slow MHC. MHC mRNA distribution in myotubes is disorganized as is the distribution of their myofibrils.},

  abstract = {We measured how much metabolic energy is expended to swing a human leg. A previous dynamical model of walking predicted that increasing metabolic costs for walking with step length and step frequency trade-off against each other to determine the optimum step combination at a given speed. Simple pendulum dynamics indicate that the cost of walking at high step frequencies could be associated with driving the legs back and forth relative to the body, at a rate increasing approximately with the fourth power of frequency, possibly due to the low economy of producing muscle force for short durations. A similar cost would be expected for isolated swinging of a leg at faster than its natural frequency. We constructed an apparatus to measure work performed on the leg, and measured metabolic cost as human subjects (N=12) swung one leg at frequencies 0.5-1.1 Hz and fixed amplitude. Rate of mechanical work ranged from 0.02-0.27 W kg(-1) over these frequencies. Net metabolic rate for leg swinging (subtracting that for quiet standing) increased from 0.41-2.10 W kg(-1), approximately with the fourth power of frequency (R(2)=0.92) and in proportion to a hypothesized cost of force production for short durations. The costs of producing force and work could account for the increase. In a crude comparison, moving the legs back and forth at a typical stride frequency of 0.9 Hz, might consume about one-third of the net energy (2.8+/-0.8 W kg(-1)) needed for walking at 1.3 m s(-1).},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths(0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length(from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

The review presents and evaluates the wealth of information and possible alternative factors in explaining the observations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Resistance training is an integral component of physical preparation for athletes. A growing body of evidence indicates that eccentric strength training methods induce novel stimuli for neuromuscular adaptations. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effects of eccentric training in comparison to concentric-only or traditional (i.e. constrained by concentric strength) resistance training. METHODS Searches were performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE via EBSCO, PubMed and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO. Full journal articles investigating the long-term (≥4 weeks) effects of eccentric training in healthy (absence of injury or illness during the 4 weeks preceding the training intervention), adult (17-35 years), human participants were selected for the systematic review. A total of 40 studies conformed to these criteria. RESULTS Eccentric training elicits greater improvements in muscle strength, although in a largely mode-specific manner. Superior enhancements in power and stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function have also been reported. Eccentric training is at least as effective as other modalities in increasing muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), while the pattern of hypertrophy appears nuanced and increased CSA may occur longitudinally within muscle (i.e. the addition of sarcomeres in series). There appears to be a preferential increase in the size of type II muscle fibres and the potential to exert a unique effect upon fibre type transitions. Qualitative and quantitative changes in tendon tissue that may be related to the magnitude of strain imposed have also been reported with eccentric training. CONCLUSIONS Eccentric training is a potent stimulus for enhancements in muscle mechanical function, and muscle-tendon unit (MTU) morphological and architectural adaptations. The inclusion of eccentric loads not constrained by concentric strength appears to be superior to traditional resistance training in improving variables associated with strength, power and speed performance.},

Characterising these parameters accurately in three dimensions is challenging with traditional methods requiring dissection or suspension of cadavers. Here, we present a method to quantify the three-dimensional centre of mass and inertia tensor of birds of prey using calibrated computed tomography (CT) scans. The technique was validated using several independent methods, providing body segment mass estimates within approximately 1\% of physical dissection measurements and moment of inertia measurements with a 0.993 R2 correlation with conventional trifilar pendulum measurements. Calibrated CT offers a relatively straightforward, non-destructive approach that yields highly detailed mass distribution data that can be used for three-dimensional dynamics modelling in biomechanics. Although demonstrated here with birds, this approach should work equally well with any animal or appendage capable of being CT scanned.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis may be induced in skeletal muscle by metabolic or mechanical factors, but whether an in vivo stimulus threshold applies for physiological angiogenesis is unknown. We compared three models of muscle overload inducing varying degrees of stretch on angiogenesis. Rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was overloaded by (a) extirpation of the synergist tibialis anterior (TA), (b) sectioning the distal tendon of the TA, or (c) release of the TA tendon by sectioning the retaining ligament. EDL samples were taken after 4, 7, 14 and 28 days to quantify capillary supply (alkaline phosphatase staining), and co-labelling for cell proliferation (using PCNA). The gradation of overload was confirmed by Western analysis of SERCA and CPT expression (1.6- to 7.2-fold and 8.3- to 33.9-fold changes, respectively), and the force characteristics of EDL. There was a significant increase in the number of new myonuclei only in the extirpated group after 7 days, while there was a graded increase in capillary-linked PCNA density (PCNAcap) among groups compared to controls. However, extirpation caused significant increase in PCNAcap after 7 days, whereas tenotomy showed a more modest and delayed increase at 14 days, and ligament transection induced no significant change. Muscle capillary supply followed a similar trend to that of PCNA, whereas the pro-angiogenic VEGF and Flk-1 protein levels were both up-regulated to a similar extent in all three experimental models 7–14 days after surgery. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that overload-induced angiogenesis is primarily a mechanical response, and that it is graded according to stimulus intensity.},

Although extensive analyses of muscle architecture\textbackslash nand fiber type have been completed in a large number of muscles in\textbackslash nnumerous species, there have been few studies that have looked at\textbackslash nthe interrelationship of these functional parameters among muscles\textbackslash nof a single species. Nor have the architectural properties of individual\textbackslash nmuscles been compared across species to understand scaling. This\textbackslash nstudy examined muscle architecture and fiber type in the rat (Rattus\textbackslash nnorvegicus) hindlimb to examine each muscle's functional specialization.\textbackslash nDiscriminant analysis demonstrated that architectural properties\textbackslash nare a greater predictor of muscle function (as defined by primary\textbackslash njoint action and anti-gravity or non anti-gravity role) than fiber\textbackslash ntype. Architectural properties were not strictly aligned with fiber\textbackslash ntype, but when muscles were grouped according to anti-gravity versus\textbackslash nnon-anti-gravity function there was evidence of functional specialization.\textbackslash nSpecifically, anti-gravity muscles had a larger percentage of slow\textbackslash nfiber type and increased muscle physiological cross-sectional area.\textbackslash nIncongruities between a muscle's architecture and fiber type may\textbackslash nreflect the variability of functional requirements on single muscles,\textbackslash nespecially those that cross multiple joints. Additionally, discriminant\textbackslash nanalysis and scaling of architectural variables in the hindlimb across\textbackslash nseveral mammalian species was used to explore whether any functional\textbackslash npatterns could be elucidated within single muscles or across muscle\textbackslash ngroups.

Animals               —5 Dutch Warmblood horses without apparent lameness or problems associated with the vertebral column.                                         Procedure               —Kinematics of 8 vertebrae (T6, T10, T13, T17, L1, L3, L5, and S3) and both tuber coxae were determined, using bone-fixated markers. Horses were recorded while walking on a treadmill at a constant speed of 1.6 m/s.                                         Results               —Flexion-extension was characterized by 2 periods of extension and flexion during 1 stride cycle, whereas lateral bending and axial rotation were characterized by 1 peak and 1 trough. The range of motion for flexion-extension was fairly constant for vertebrae caudal to T10 (approximately 7°). For lateral bending, the cranial thoracic vertebrae and segments in the pelvic region had the maximal amount of motion, with values of up to 5.6°. For vertebrae between T17 and L5, the amount of lateral bending decreased to {$<$} 4°. The amount of axial rotation increased gradually from 4° for T6 to 13° for the tuber coxae.                                         Conclusions               —This direct measurement method provides 3-dimensional kinematic data for flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation of the thoracolumbar portion of the vertebral column of horses walking on a treadmill. Regional differences were observed in the magnitude and pattern of the rotations. Understanding of the normal kinematics of the vertebral column in healthy horses is a prerequisite for a better understanding of abnormal function.

  abstract = {Summary                            Most research on equine kinematics has previously been performed in the walking and/or trotting animal. This is also true for the few studies on the kinematics of the equine back. These studies have, for the major part, focused on the flexion‐extension movement in the sagittal plane. However, vertebrae can rotate in 3 dimensions. This study was designed to determine all 3 rotations in various segments of the vertebral column of a cantering horse. Five Dutch Warmblood horses were measured during treadmill canter (7.3 m/s). Steinmann pins were inserted into the dorsal spinous processes of 8 thoracic (T), lumbar (L) and sacral (S) vertebrae and into both               tubera coxae.               A set of 4 markers was rigidly attached to each pin. The marker data were used to calculate a rotation matrix that was subsequently decomposed into 3 orthogonal rotations (flexion/extension [FE]; lateral bending [LB] and axial rotation [AR]). For the 3 rotations the variability between the horses was low for FE, slightly larger for AR and largest for LB. The maximal range of motion (mean ± s.d.) for FE, LB and AR was 15.8 ± 1.3°, 5.2 ± 0.7° and 7.8 ± 1.2°, respectively. With respect to relative angles, the largest FE motion was found between L5 and S3 with values for the range of motion up to 8.6°. Simultaneous rotation of successive vertebrae was observed particularly during the single support and suspension phases in the stride cycle, which increases spinal stability. For all rotations, a close correlation was observed between the timing of the vertebral rotations and the pro‐ and retraction of the limbs.},

While the influence of the performance criterion on the predicted walking pattern has been previously studied, the influence of the mechanics has been less explored. Here, we investigated the influence of two mechanical assumptions on the predicted walking pattern: the complexity of the foot segment and the stiffness of the Achilles tendon. We found, through three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of walking, that modeling the toes and metatarsophalangeal joints, and thus using two-segment instead of single-segment foot models, contributed to robustly eliciting physiological stance knee flexion angles, knee extension torques, and knee extensor activity. Yet modeling toe joints did not improve ankle kinematics, nor did decreasing the Achilles tendon stiffness. The lack of predicted terminal stance ankle plantarflexion thereby remains an open question. Overall, this simulation study shows that not only the performance criterion but also mechanical assumptions affect predictive simulations of walking. Improving the realism of predictive simulations is required for their application in clinical contexts. Here, we suggest that using complex models is needed to yield such realism.},

  abstract = {Physics-based predictive simulations of human movement have the potential to support personalized medicine, but large computational costs and difficulties to model control strategies have limited their use. We have developed a computationally efficient optimal control framework to predict human gaits based on optimization of a performance criterion without relying on experimental data. The framework generates three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations in 36 min on average-more than 20 times faster than existing simulations-by using direct collocation, implicit differential equations and algorithmic differentiation. Using this framework, we identified a multi-objective performance criterion combining energy and effort considerations that produces physiologically realistic walking gaits. The same criterion also predicted the walk-to-run transition and clinical gait deficiencies caused by muscle weakness and prosthesis use, suggesting that diverse healthy and pathological gaits can emerge from the same control strategy. The ability to predict the mechanics and energetics of a broad range of gaits with complex three-dimensional musculoskeletal models will allow testing novel hypotheses about gait control and hasten the development of optimal treatments for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders.},

  abstract = {Dinosaur locomotor biomechanics are of major interest. Locomotion of an animal affects many, if not most, aspects of life reconstruction, including behaviour, performance, ecology and appearance. Yet locomotion is one aspect of non-avian dinosaurs that we cannot directly observe. To shed light on how dinosaurs moved, we must draw from multiple sources of evidence. Extant taxa provide the basic principles of locomotion, bracket soft-tissue reconstructions and provide validation data for methods and hypotheses applied to dinosaurs. The skeletal evidence itself can be used directly to reconstruct posture, range of motion and mass (segment and whole-body). Building on skeletal reconstructions, musculoskeletal models inform muscle function and form the basis of simulations to test hypotheses of locomotor performance. Finally, fossilized footprints are our only direct record of motion and can provide important snapshots of extinct animals, shedding light on speed, gait and posture. Building confident reconstructions of dinosaur locomotion requires evidence from all four sources of information. This review explores recent work in these areas, with a methodological focus.},

Horses naturally switched from a trot to a gallop at a speed where galloping required more energy than trotting, and thus, the gait transition actually increased the energetic cost of running. However, by galloping at this speed, the peak forces on the muscles, tendons, and bones, and presumably the chance of injury, are reduced. When the horses carried weights, they switched from a trot to a gallop at a lower speed but at the same critical level of force. These findings suggest that the trot-gallop transition is triggered when musculoskeletal forces reach a critical level.},

From the volume of this model, we estimate the live mass of the full-sized dinosaur as approximately 6,000 kg. Because MOR 555 is a representative of the gracile morph of T. rex, the mass of the robust morph may have been substantially greater. The "indicator ofathletic ability" or "strength indicator" ofMOR 555 is 7.5-9.0 meter-/giganewton, similar to previously reported results. The implication is that the cursorial potential of Tyrannosaurus was limited, a conclusion consistent with observed declines in sprint speed with increasing body mass in living animals, and also consistent with the tibia/femur length ratio, and the construction of the hip joint, of the dinosaur. Furthermore, mathematical models of the impact forces and decelerations that would affect a Tyrannosaurus, were it to fall while running at a high speed (20 meters/second), suggest that the animal would be killed in such an accident. We speculate that the top speed ofadult individuals of this dinosaur species was about 10 meters/second.},

  abstract = {Using synchronous kinematic and kinetic data in simulations of human running typically leads to dynamic inconsistencies. Minimizing residual forces and moments is subsequently important to ensure plausible model outputs. A variety of approaches suitable for residual reduction are available in OpenSim; however, a detailed comparison is yet to be conducted. This study compared OpenSim tools applicable for residual reduction in simulations of human running. Multiple approaches (i.e. Residual Reduction Algorithm,               MocoTrack               ,               AddBiomechanics               ) designed to reduce residual forces and moments were examined using an existing dataset of treadmill running at 5.0 ms               −1               . The computational time, residual forces and moments, and joint kinematics and kinetics from each approach were compared. A computational cost to residual reduction trade-off was identified, where lower residuals were achieved using approaches with longer computational times. The               AddBiomechanics               and               MocoTrack               approaches produced variable lower and upper body kinematics, respectively, versus the remaining approaches. Joint kinetics were similar between approaches; however,               MocoTrack               generated noisier upper limb joint torque signals.               MocoTrack               was the best-performing approach for reducing residuals to near-zero levels, at the cost of longer computational times. This study provides OpenSim users with evidence to inform decision-making at the residual reduction step of their workflow.},

Raoulia               were studied to explore their distributional properties and discriminating abilities. The ratios are shown to be generally less normal than their constituents, a property that can (to varying degrees) be alleviated by the choice of the numerator as the constituent with the largest coefficient of variation. The discriminating properties of the ratios are shown to be as good as their constituents individually, implying that the ratios are potentially useful variables with unique properties. The problem of redundant variability as a product of including a ratio variable and its two constituents in a data set is also addressed. Given that the deletion of one of these variables is a solution to this, it is shown that removing the ratio does not necessarily optimise the amount of retained variability. Thus, the use of ratio variables is seen to be an empirical a posteriori decision that can be made on the basis of objective criteria.},

In humans, skeletal muscle comprises approximately 40\% of total body weight and contains 50-75\% of all body proteins.

In this review, we discuss the various domains of muscle structure and function including its cytoskeletal architecture, excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, and force and power generation. We will limit the discussion to human skeletal muscle and emphasize recent scientific literature on single muscle fibers.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Computational models of musculoskeletal systems are essential tools for understanding how muscles, tendons, bones, and actuation signals generate motion. In particular, the OpenSim family of models has facilitated a wide range of studies on diverse human motions, clinical studies of gait, and even non-human locomotion. However, biological structures with many joints, such as fingers, necks, tails, and spines, have been a longstanding challenge to the OpenSim modeling community, especially because these structures comprise numerous bones and are frequently actuated by extrinsic muscles that span multiple joints—often more than three—and act through a complex network of branching tendons. Existing model building software, typically optimized for limb structures, makes it difficult to build OpenSim models that accurately reflect these intricacies. Here, we introduce             ArborSim             , customized software that efficiently creates musculoskeletal models of highly jointed structures and can build branched muscle-tendon architectures. We used             ArborSim             to construct toy models of articulated structures to determine which morphological features make a structure most sensitive to branching. By comparing the joint kinematics of models constructed with branched and parallel muscle-tendon units, we found that the number of tendon branches and the number of joints between branches are most sensitive to branching modeling method—notably, the differences between these models showed no predictable pattern with increased complexity. As the proportion of muscle increased, the kinematic differences between branched and parallel models units also increased. Our findings suggest that stress and strain interactions between distal tendon branches and proximal tendon and muscle greatly affect the overall kinematics of a musculoskeletal system. By incorporating complex muscle-tendon branching into OpenSim models using             ArborSim             , we can gain deeper insight into the interactions between the axial and appendicular skeleton, model the evolution and function of diverse animal tails, and understand the mechanics of more complex motions and tasks.},

  abstract = {Reported specific tension measurements for human skeletal muscle vary widely. This variability could be due, at least in part, to the determination of the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscles. In the present study, serial magnetic resonance images were taken every 10 mm along the lower leg of 8 male subjects to calculate the volume and subsequently the PCSAs of the individual muscles producing plantar flexor and dorsiflexor torques. Maximum plantar flexor and dorsiflexor voluntary isometric torques were determined at ankle joint angles of 90, 100, 110, and 120 degrees. Peak tendon force estimated from torque and moment arm measurements was more than fourfold higher in the plantar flexors (3,623 +/- 136 N) than in the dorsiflexors (832 +/- 19 N). PCSAs were about eight- and threefold higher than the anatomic cross-sectional areas at the level of maximum girth of the calf for the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor groups, respectively. Mean muscle volume and PCSA were 4.6 and 12 times larger in the plantar flexors compared with the dorsiflexors, respectively. The PCSAs of both plantar flexors (r = 0.92) and dorsiflexors (r = 0.80) were highly correlated with the tendon tension of the respective muscle groups. The maximum specific tension was more than twofold higher in dorsiflexors than in plantar flexors. These data suggest that factors other than PCSA contribute to the force output potential of ankle plantar flexors and dorsiflexors in humans.},

The ligaments proved to be deviated around the intercondylar groove (cranial cruciate) and around the medial femoral condyle (caudal cruciate). Four functionally different fiber groups could be differentiated: fibers taut only in maximal extension, fibers taut only in maximal flexion, fibers taut in ranges from an intermediate position to an extreme position, and fibers taut throughout the entire range of motion (guiding bundles). Hence the cruciates serve the guiding of the joint and the restriction of motion, whereby the majority of the cranial cruciate fibers are taut in extension while those of the caudal cruciate are in flexion. No differences were found between the species examined with respect to fiber arrangement and function. The avian mechanical model proved to be more complex than the relatively simple mammalian four‐bar link model as the avian guiding bundles change their shape due to deflection during motion. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The avian automatic perching mechanism (APM) involves the automatic digital flexor mechanism (ADFM) and the digital tendon‐locking mechanism (DTLM). When birds squat on a perch to sleep, the increased tendon travel distance due to flexion of the knee and ankle supposedly causes the toes to grip the perch (ADFM) and engage the DTLM so perching while sleeping involves no muscular effort. However, the knees and ankles of sleeping European starlings (               Sturnus vulgaris               ) are only slightly flexed and, except for occasional balancing adjustments, the distal two‐thirds of the toes are not flexed to grip a 6‐mm‐diameter perch. The cranial ankle angle (CAA) is ∼120° and the foot forms an inverted “U” that, with the mostly unflexed toes, provides a saddle‐like structure so the bird balances its weight over the central pad of the foot (during day weight further back and digits actively grasp perch). In the region of the pad, the tendon sheath of many birds is unribbed, or only very slightly so, and it is always separated from the tendon of the M. flexor digitorum longus by tendons of the other toe flexor muscles. Passive leg flexion produces no toe flexion in anesthetized Starlings and only after 15–20 min, at the onset of rigor mortis, in freshly sacrificed Starlings. Anesthetized Starlings could not remain perched upon becoming unconscious (ADFM, DTLM intact). Birds whose digital flexor tendons were severed or the locking mechanism eliminated surgically (no ADFM or DTLM), so without ability to flex their toes, slept on the perch in a manner similar to unoperated Starlings (except CAA ∼90°–110°). Consequently, there is no APM or ADFM and the DTLM, although involved in lots of other activities, only acts in perching with active contraction of the digital flexor muscles. J. Exp. Zool.

Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT).

Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115\% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07±0.05 m s−1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13±0.07 m s−1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5\%).

  abstract = {The neuromuscular control of the hind limb of helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) locomoting on a treadmill at 1.0 m/sec was analyzed using simultaneous electromyography (EMG) and cineradiography. Activity from 16 heads representing 14 hip and knee muscles was recorded and correlated with limb movement and myological data to help discern muscle function. The first half of the stance phase is characterized by activity in many hip extensors, which counteract a flexor moment of the ground reaction force to yield hip stability. Simultaneously, medial rotators of the femur mediate pelvic roll and coactive antagonists about the knee control knee flexion of ca. 60°. Later in stance, hip extensors pull the hip through an arc of ca. 25°; knee extension occurs in some strides. N. meleagris hind limb motor patterns were compared to those of their homologs in representative lizards and crocodilians. Using a cladogram of living saurians, motor patterns were reconstructed in hypothetical ancestors. Although data are limited, lizards appear to have very conservative muscle activity similar to that of the ancestral saurian. The extant crocodilian Alligator mississippiensis resembles the reconstructed ancestor of Archosauria in at least 9 of 11 hind limb motor patterns. In contrast, N. meleagris differs from this same ancestor in at least four muscles. Most novelties in extant saurian motor patterns arose on the line to living birds. J.

  abstract = {Abstract             The last common ancestor of birds and crocodylians plus all of its descendants (clade Archosauria) dominated terrestrial Mesozoic ecosystems, giving rise to disparate body plans, sizes, and modes of locomotion. As in the fields of vertebrate morphology and paleontology more generally, studies of archosaur skeletal structure have come to depend on tools for acquiring, measuring, and exploring three‐dimensional (3‐D) digital models. Such models, in turn, form the basis for many analyses of musculoskeletal function. A set of shared conventions for describing 3‐D pose (joint or limb configuration) and 3‐D kinematics (change in pose through time) is essential for fostering comparison of posture/movement among such varied species, as well as for maximizing communication among scientists. Following researchers in human biomechanics, we propose a standard methodological approach for measuring the relative position and orientation of the major segments of the archosaur pelvis and hindlimb in 3‐D. We describe the construction of anatomical and joint coordinate systems using the extant guineafowl and alligator as examples. Our new standards are then applied to three extinct taxa sampled from the wider range of morphological, postural, and kinematic variation that has arisen across {$>$}250 million years of archosaur evolution. These proposed conventions, and the founding principles upon which they are based, can also serve as starting points for measuring poses between elements within a hindlimb segment, for establishing coordinate systems in the forelimb and axial skeleton, or for applying our archosaurian system more broadly to different vertebrate clades.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Three‐dimensional skeletal movement is often impossible to accurately quantify from external markers. X‐ray imaging more directly visualizes moving bones, but extracting 3‐D kinematic data is notoriously difficult from a single perspective. Stereophotogrammetry is extremely powerful if bi‐planar fluoroscopy is available, yet implantation of three radio‐opaque markers in each segment of interest may be impractical. Herein we introduce scientific rotoscoping (SR), a new method of motion analysis that uses articulated bone models to simultaneously animate and quantify moving skeletons without markers. The three‐step process is described using examples from our work on pigeon flight and alligator walking. First, the experimental scene is reconstructed in 3‐D using commercial animation software so that frames of undistorted fluoroscopic and standard video can be viewed in their correct spatial context through calibrated virtual cameras. Second, polygonal models of relevant bones are created from CT or laser scans and rearticulated into a hierarchical marionette controlled by virtual joints. Third, the marionette is registered to video images by adjusting each of its degrees of freedom over a sequence of frames. SR outputs high‐resolution 3‐D kinematic data for multiple, unmarked bones and anatomically accurate animations that can be rendered from any perspective. Rather than generating moving stick figures abstracted from the coordinates of independent surface points, SR is a morphology‐based method of motion analysis deeply rooted in osteological and arthrological data.

In the study, we examined the head and neck movements of Standard-bred horses exercising on a treadmill, and calculated the mechanical work performed by the head and neck segments at the walk, trot and canter. The position of the head and neck relative to the trunk was used to calculate the elastic strain energy stored in the nuchal ligament during the head movements of locomotion. These data allowed us to estimate the proportion of oscillatory work that is contributed by passive components of the equine neck. Elastic strain energy stored in the nuchal ligament contributes 55\% of the work of moving the head and neck at the walk, and 33\% and 31\% respectively at the trot and canter. By substituting passive nuchal ligament work for active muscular work, the horse is able to reduce its metabolic cost of locomotion.}

  abstract = {Head and neck movements in horses are characteristic at each gait, implying that the oscillation patterns are an intrinsic part of locomotion. In the study, we examined the head and neck movements of Standard-bred horses exercising on a treadmill, and calculated the mechanical work performed by the head and neck segments at the walk, trot and canter. The position of the head and neck relative to the trunk was used to calculate the elastic strain energy stored in the nuchal ligament during the head movements of locomotion. These data allowed us to estimate the proportion of oscillatory work that is contributed by passive components of the equine neck. Elastic strain energy stored in the nuchal ligament contributes 55\% of the work of moving the head and neck at the walk, and 33\% and 31\% respectively at the trot and canter. By substituting passive nuchal ligament work for active muscular work, the horse is able to reduce its metabolic cost of locomotion.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Elephants are the biggest living terrestrial animal, weighing up to five tons and measuring up to three metres at the withers. These exceptional dimensions provide certain advantages (e.g. the mass-specific energetic cost of locomotion is decreased) but also disadvantages (e.g. forces are proportional to body volume while supportive tissue strength depends on their cross-sectional area, which makes elephants relatively more fragile than smaller animals). In order to understand better how body size affects gait mechanics the movement of the centre of mass (COM) of 34 Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) was studied over their entire speed range of 0.4-5.0 m s−1 with force platforms. The mass-specific mechanical work required to maintain the movements of the COM per unit distance is \textasciitilde 0.2 J kg−1 m−1 (about 1/3 of the average of other animals ranging in size from a 35 g kangaroo rat to a 70 kg human). At low speeds this work is reduced by a pendulum-like exchange between the kinetic and potential energies of the COM, with a maximum energy exchange of \textasciitilde 60\% at 1.4 m s−1. At high speeds, elephants use a bouncing mechanism with little exchange between kinetic and potential energies of the COM, although without an aerial phase. Elephants increase speed while reducing the vertical oscillation of the COM from about 3 cm to 1 cm.},

Here, we show that muscle reflexes could be vital to link these two observations. We develop a model of human locomotion that is controlled by muscle reflexes which encode principles of legged mechanics. Equipped with this reflex control, we find this model to stabilize into a walking gait from its dynamic interplay with the ground, reproduce human walking dynamics and leg kinematics, tolerate ground disturbances, and adapt to slopes without parameter interventions. In addition, we find this model to predict some individual muscle activation patterns known from walking experiments. The results suggest not only that the interplay between mechanics and motor control is essen- tial to human locomotion, but also that human motor output could for some muscles be dominated by neural circuits that encode principles of legged mechanics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Morphologists have historically had to rely on destructive procedures to visualize the three‐dimensional (3‐D) anatomy of animals. More recently, however, non‐destructive techniques have come to the forefront. These include X‐ray computed tomography (               CT               ), which has been used most commonly to examine the mineralized, hard‐tissue anatomy of living and fossil metazoans. One relatively new and potentially transformative aspect of current               CT               ‐based research is the use of chemical agents to render visible, and differentiate between, soft‐tissue structures in X‐ray images. Specifically, iodine has emerged as one of the most widely used of these contrast agents among animal morphologists due to its ease of handling, cost effectiveness, and differential affinities for major types of soft tissues. The rapid adoption of iodine‐based contrast agents has resulted in a proliferation of distinct specimen preparations and scanning parameter choices, as well as an increasing variety of imaging hardware and software preferences. Here we provide a critical review of the recent contributions to iodine‐based, contrast‐enhanced               CT               research to enable researchers just beginning to employ contrast enhancement to make sense of this complex new landscape of methodologies. We provide a detailed summary of recent case studies, assess factors that govern success at each step of the specimen storage, preparation, and imaging processes, and make recommendations for standardizing both techniques and reporting practices. Finally, we discuss potential cutting‐edge applications of diffusible iodine‐based contrast‐enhanced computed tomography (dice               CT               ) and the issues that must still be overcome to facilitate the broader adoption of dice               CT               going forward.},

  abstract = {Understanding how animals actually use their muscles during locomotion is an important goal in the fields of locomotor physiology and biomechanics. Active muscles in vivo can shorten, lengthen or remain isometric, and their mechanical performance depends on the relative magnitude and timing of these patterns of fascicle strain and activation. It has recently been suggested that terrestrial animals may conserve metabolic energy during locomotion by minimizing limb extensor muscle strain during stance, when the muscle is active, facilitating more economical force generation and elastic energy recovery from limb muscle-tendon units. However, whereas the ankle extensors of running turkeys and hopping wallabies have been shown to generate force with little length change ({$<$}6\% strain), similar muscles in cats appear to change length more substantially while active. Because previous work has tended to focus on the mechanical behavior of ankle extensors during animal movements, the actions of more proximal limb muscles are less well understood. To explore further the hypothesis of force economy and isometric behavior of limb muscles during terrestrial locomotion, we measured patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activity and fascicle strain (using sonomicrometry) in two of the largest muscles of the rat hindlimb, the biceps femoris (a hip extensor) and vastus lateralis (a knee extensor) during walking, trotting and galloping. Our results show that the biceps and vastus exhibit largely overlapping bursts of electrical activity during the stance phase of each step cycle in all gaits. During walking and trotting, this activity typically commences shortly before the hindlimb touches the ground, but during galloping the onset of activity depends on whether the limb is trailing (first limb down) or leading (second limb down), particularly in the vastus. In the trailing limb, the timing of the onset of vastus activity is slightly earlier than that observed during walking and trotting, but in the leading limb, this activity begins much later, well after the foot makes ground contact (mean 7\% of the step cycle). In both muscles, EMG activity typically ceases approximately two-thirds of the way through the stance phase. While electrically active during stance, biceps fascicles shorten, although the extent of shortening differs significantly among gaits (P{$<$}0.01). Total average fascicle shortening strain in the biceps is greater during walking (23+/-3\%) and trotting (27+/-5\%) than during galloping (12+/-5\% and 19+/-6\% in the trailing and leading limbs, respectively). In contrast, vastus fascicles typically lengthen (by 8-16\%, depending on gait) over the first half of stance, when the muscle is electrically active, before shortening slightly or remaining nearly isometric over much of the second half of stance. Interestingly, in the leading limb during galloping, vastus fascicles lengthen prior to muscle activation and exhibit substantial shortening (10+/-2\%) during the period when EMG activity is recorded. Thus, patterns of muscle activation and/or muscle strain differ among gaits, between muscles and even within the same muscle of contralateral hindlimbs (as during galloping). In contrast to the minimal strain predicted by the force economy hypothesis, our results suggest that proximal limb muscles in rats operate over substantial length ranges during stance over various speeds and gaits and exhibit complex and changing activation and strain regimes, exemplifying the variable mechanical roles that muscles can play, even during level, steady-speed locomotion.},

The passive length-tension properties of the denervated immobilized muscles were not significantly different from those of non-denervated muscles. Muscles immobilized in the shortened position showed a marked decrease in extensibility whether they were denervated or not. In all the other cases the length-tension curves were not significantly differetn from those of normal muscles.3. The denervated soleus muscle immobilized in the lengthened position was found to produce 25\% more sarcomeres in series, whilst those immobilized in the shortened position lost 35\%. This adaptation was essentially the same as in muscles that had been immobilized but not denervated.4. Denervation was found to have no effect on the recovery of muscles that had been subjected to 4 weeks immobilization in the shortened position. In these muscles the sarcomere increased back to the normal level within 4 weeks after removal of the plaster cast.5. The adjustment of sarcomere number to the functional length of the muscles does not therefore seem to be directly under neuronal control. It appears to be a myogenic response to the amount of passive tension the muscle is subjected to.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A cinematographic analysis of the unrestrained walking, trotting, galloping, jumping and landing movements of 11 adult cats was undertaken to provide previously unavailable information concerning the demands imposed on the nervous system for the control of low and high speed movements and the demands imposed by such natural movements on muscle performance and proprioceptive response.                            With due regard for the swing (F and E               1               ) and stance (E               2               and E               3               ) phases of the step cycle of an individual limb, single frame analysis of the film permitted measurement of instantaneous angles of the lower spine, hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints. Appropriate lever arm measurements were also made on 50 freshly dispatched cats and 25 cadavers such that the Law of Cosines could be used to calculate instantaneous lengths of select hind limb muscles that would apply to the natural movements of adult cats of small (1.5–2.5 Kg), intermediate (2.6–3.5 Kg) and large (3.6–4.5 Kg) size. Muscle displacements were analyzed relative to maximum and minimus               in situ               lengths and the lengths associated with quiet standing. Use was also made of a previous electromyographic analysis of hind limb muscles during unrestrained locomotion (Engberg and Lundberg, '69).                                         The sequential relations between the four phases of the step cycle are maintained as forward speed increases from walking ( {$<$} 2 mph) to high speed galloping ( {$>$} 16 mph). There are significant differences in the time consumed by each phase, however, with a greater reduction in the E               3               phase, little reduction in the E               2               and E               1               phases and virtually no reduction in the F phase. When each phase is expressed as a relative percentage of the duration of the total step cycle, the greatest reduction is again in E               3               with little change in the E               2               phase. In contrast F and E               1               phases increase in the percent of time they occur in each cycle, with the greatest increase in the F phase. For all speeds, analysis of the phase relations between movements of various sections of the hind limb revealed a remarkable unity of knee and ankle joint movement. The hip joint is largely out of phase with the knee and ankle during E               1               and E               2               , all three joints being in phase in F and E               3               . The digits are essentially out of phase with the other joints except in the stance phase of the gallop.                                         Rates and extents of muscle displacement during natural movements are greater than might be anticipated when expressed in absolute mm's and mm/sec but not when considered in relation to maximum and minimum               in situ               length and the length associated with quiet standing (Ls). During stepping a progressive increase in forward speed results in: (a) a greater usage of muscles at lengths between Ls and maximum               in situ               length; (b) for knee and ankle extensors, pronounced increase in the lengthening contraction associated with the E               2               (yield) phase of step; and, (c) for both flexor and extensor muscles, an increased active phase of lengthening or near isometric contraction immediately prior to periods of active shortening. In contrast to these changes in               active               muscle status, the change from walking to galloping has little effect on the extent and rate of               passive               muscle displacements, particularly the F phase stretch of extensors.                          For the soleus muscle, calculations were made of the relation between changes in overall muscle length during natural movements and the length of the average muscle fiber and the tendon of insertion. These measurements revealed that the increases in fiber length when passive and decreases in length during active shortening are less than would be anticipated from the extensive liteature on extirpated fibers. In contrast, the increase in fiber length when active is greater than would be expected from the admittedly sparse literature on this subject.                            The results of this study are discussed largely in relation to two points of neurophysiological interest: the physiological range of muscle stretch as it pertains to the responsiveness of muscle spindles and tendon organs; and those mechanical aspects of lengthening contractions that give insight into the neural control of stepping. For exciting both spindles and tendon organs passive muscle stretch and shortening contractions are shown to be relatively ineffective and lengthening and isometric contractions particularly effective movements. It is suggested that, just as recent literature has emphasized the co‐activation of efferent alpha and gamma motoneurons as a muscle becomes active, so too is there a synchronous activation of afferents, particularly the Ia and group II endings of muscle spindles and Ib endings of tendon organs. Finally the thesis is advanced that, while it has been convenient to separate E               2               from E               3               in the description of the stance phase of the step cycle, extensor muscles are actually undergoing a single mechanical event: an active stretch‐shorten cycle for knee and ankle extensors and an active isometric‐shorten cycle for hip extensors. This hypothesis has significant implications for the neural control program that regulates the stepping sequence in that it emphasizes the extent to which appropriate changes must be preprogrammed in the mechanical properties of muscles for the smooth execution of stepping.},

  abstract = {Lower-limb amputees can suffer from preventable pain and bone disorders attributable to suboptimal prosthesis design. Predictive modelling and simulation of human walking using conventional biomechanical gait models offer an alternative to intuition-based prosthesis design, providing insight into the biomechanics underlying pathological gait. Musculoskeletal models additionally enable understanding of prosthesis contributions to the human musculoskeletal system, and both prosthesis and individual muscle contributions to body support and propulsion during gait. Based on this review, forward dynamic simulation of amputee musculoskeletal models have been used to perform prosthesis design optimization using optimal control and reflex-based control. Musculoskeletal model complexity and assumptions inhibit fully predictive musculoskeletal modelling in its current state, hindering computational prosthesis design optimization. Future recommendations include validating musculoskeletal models and resultant optimized prosthesis designs, developing less computationally-expensive predictive musculoskeletal modelling methods, and developing more efficient patientspecific musculoskeletal model generation methods to enable personalized prosthesis optimization.},

Although the SL is highly prone to injury in horses of all ages and competing in a wide range of disciplines, knowledge regarding fundamental structure–function relationships in the SL is lacking, particularly compared with other injury‐prone tendinous structures such as the superficial digital flexor tendon. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of SL composition, structure and mechanical properties and describe the epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology of injuries.

  abstract = {The objectives of this pilot study were to develop a video fluoroscopy kinematics method for the assessment of the coxofemoral joint in cats with and without osteoarthritis (OA)-associated disability. Two non-OA cats and four cats affected by coxofemoral OA were evaluated by video fluoroscopy. Video fluoroscopic images of the coxofemoral joints were captured at 120 frames/s using a customized C-arm X-ray system while cats walked freely on a treadmill at 0.4 m/s. The angle patterns over time of the coxofemoral joints were extracted using a graphic user interface following four steps: (i) correction for image distortion; (ii) image denoising and contrast enhancement; (iii) frame-to-frame anatomical marker identification; and (iv) statistical gait analysis. Reliability analysis was performed. The cats with OA presented greater intra-subject stride and gait cycle variability. Three cats with OA presented a left–right asymmetry in the range of movement of the coxofemoral joint angle in the sagittal plane (two with no overlap of the 95\% confidence interval, and one with only a slight overlap) consistent with their painful OA joint, and a longer gait cycle duration. Reliability analysis revealed an absolute variation in the coxofemoral joint angle of 2º–6º, indicating that the two-dimensional video fluoroscopy technique provided reliable data. Improvement of this method is recommended: variability would likely be reduced if a larger field of view could be recorded, allowing the identification and tracking of each femoral axis, rather than the trochanter landmarks. The range of movement of the coxofemoral joint has the potential to be an objective marker of OA-associated disability.},

  abstract = {It is state of the art that muscle contraction dynamics is adequately described by a hyperbolic relation between muscle force and contraction velocity (Hill relation), thereby neglecting muscle internal mass inertia (first-order dynamics). Accordingly, the vast majority of modelling approaches also neglect muscle internal inertia. Assuming that such first-order contraction dynamics yet interacts with muscle internal mass distribution, this study investigates two questions: (i) what is the time scale on which the muscle responds to a force step? (ii) How does this response scale with muscle design parameters? Thereto, we simulated accelerated contractions of alternating sequences of Hill-type contractile elements and point masses. We found that in a typical small muscle the force levels off after about 0.2\,ms, contraction velocity after about 0.5\,ms. In an upscaled version representing bigger mammals' muscles, the force levels off after about 20\,ms, and the theoretically expected maximum contraction velocity is not reached. We conclude (i) that it may be indispensable to introduce second-order contributions into muscle models to understand high-frequency muscle responses, particularly in bigger muscles. Additionally, (ii) constructing more elaborate measuring devices seems to be worthwhile to distinguish viscoelastic and inertia properties in rapid contractile responses of muscles.},

This study defines the biomechanical distinction between walks and runs in the Elegant‐crested Tinamou               Eudromia elegans               using ground reaction forces. Three birds were filmed at 250~Hz from a lateral view as they moved over a force plate built into a trackway. Centre of mass mechanics and kinematic variables were analysed in 81 steady‐speed trials that represented a speed range from 0.66 to 2.78~m/s.               E.~elegans               undergoes two speed‐related changes in locomotor mechanics. The first is a shift from walking strides that utilize vaulting mechanics to low‐speed runs that exhibit bouncing mechanics; this transition occurs at Froude numbers between 0.4 and 0.6. Such low‐speed runs exhibit duty factors exceeding 0.5 and, hence, lack an aerial phase between steps. The second transition, from grounded running to aerial running, occurs when duty factors decrease below 0.5. Grounded running in birds may enhance vision by stabilizing visual stimuli over the retina. The eventual incorporation of an aerial phase during running enables increased locomotor speeds primarily through longer stride lengths.},

However, few studies have attempted to systematically explore technique modifications from a performance enhancement perspective. The aims of this investigation were therefore to explore how hypothetical technique modifications affect accelerative sprinting performance and assess whether the hypothetical modifications support the front-side mechanics coaching framework. A three-dimensional musculoskeletal model scaled to an international male sprinter was used in combination with direct collocation optimal control to perform (data-tracking and predictive) simulations of the preliminary steps of accelerative sprinting. The predictive simulations differed in the net joint moments that were left ‘free’ to change. It was found that the ‘knee-free’ and ‘knee-hip-free’ simulations resulted in the greatest performance improvements (13.8\% and 21.9\%, respectively), due to a greater knee flexor moment around touchdown (e.g., 141.2 vs. 70.5 Nm) and a delayed and greater knee extensor moment during stance (e.g., 188.5 vs. 137.5 Nm). Lastly, the predictive simulations which led to the greatest improvements were also found to not exhibit clear and noticeable front-side mechanics technique, thus the underpinning principles of the coaching framework may not be the only key aspect governing accelerative sprinting.},

  abstract = {Biomechanical simulation and modelling approaches have the possibility to make a meaningful impact within applied sports settings, such as sprinting. However, for this to be realised, such approaches must first undergo a thorough quantitative evaluation against experimental data. We developed a musculoskeletal modelling and simulation framework for sprinting, with the objective to evaluate its ability to reproduce experimental kinematics and kinetics data for different sprinting phases. This was achieved by performing a series of data-tracking calibration (individual and simultaneous) and validation simulations, that also featured the generation of dynamically consistent simulated outputs and the determination of foot-ground contact model parameters. The simulated values from the calibration simulations were found to be in close agreement with the corresponding experimental data, particularly for the kinematics (average root mean squared differences (RMSDs) less than 1.0° and 0.2 cm for the rotational and translational kinematics, respectively) and ground reaction force (highest average percentage RMSD of 8.1\%). Minimal differences in tracking performance were observed when concurrently determining the foot-ground contact model parameters from each of the individual or simultaneous calibration simulations. The validation simulation yielded results that were comparable (RMSDs less than 1.0° and 0.3 cm for the rotational and translational kinematics, respectively) to those obtained from the calibration simulations. This study demonstrated the suitability of the proposed framework for performing future predictive simulations of sprinting, and gives confidence in its use to assess the cause-effect relationships of technique modification in relation to performance. Furthermore, this is the first study to provide dynamically consistent three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations of sprinting across different phases.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Archosaurs displayed an evolutionary trend toward increasing bipedalism in their evolutionary history, that is, forelimbs tend to be reduced in contrast to the development of hindlimbs becoming major weight‐bearing and locomotor appendages. The archosaurian locomotion has been extensively discussed based on their limb morphology because the latter reflects their locomotor modes very well. However, despite some attempts of reconstructing the hindlimb musculature in Archosauria, that of the most distal portion, the pes, has often been neglected. In order to rectify this trend, detailed homologies of pedal muscles among sauropsids were established based on dissections and literature reviews of adult conditions. As a result, homologies of some pedal muscles between non‐avian sauropsids and avians were revised, challenging classical hypotheses. The present new hypothesis postulates that the avian m. tibialis cranialis and non‐avian m. extensor digitorum longus, as well as the avian m. extensor digitorum longus and non‐avian m. tibialis anterior, are homologous with each other, respectively. This is more plausible because it requires no drastical change in the attachment sites between the avian and non‐avian homologues unlike the classical hypothesis. Many interosseous muscles in non‐archosaurian sauropsids that have long been regarded as a part of short digital extensors or flexors are also divided into multiple distinct muscles so that they can be homologized with short pedal muscles among all sauropsids. In addition, osteological correlates of attachments are identified for most of the pedal muscles, contributing to future attempts of reconstruction of this muscle system in fossil archosaurs.},

  abstract = {Theropods form a taxonomically and morphologically diverse group of dinosaurs that include extant birds. Inferred relationships between theropod clades are complex and have changed dramatically over the past thirty years with the emergence of cladistic techniques. Here, we present a brief historical perspective of theropod discoveries and classification, as well as an overview on the current systematics of non-avian theropods. The first scientifically recorded theropod remains dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries come from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire and most likely belong to the megalosaurid Megalosaurus. The latter was the first theropod genus to be named in 1824, and subsequent theropod material found before 1850 can all be referred to megalosauroids. In the fifty years from 1856 to 1906, theropod remains were reported from all continents but Antarctica. The clade Theropoda was erected by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1881, and in its current usage corresponds to an intricate ladder-like organization of ‘family’ to ‘superfamily’ level clades. The earliest definitive theropods come from the Carnian of Argentina, and coelophysoids form the first significant theropod radiation from the Late Triassic to their extinction in the Early Jurassic. Most subsequent theropod clades such as ceratosaurs, allosauroids, tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, therizinosaurs, oviraptorosaurs, dromaeosaurids, and troodontids persisted until the end of the Cretaceous, though the megalosauroid clade did not extend into the Maastrichtian. Current debates are focused on the monophyly of deinonychosaurs, the position of dilophosaurids within coelophysoids, and megaraptorans among neovenatorids. Some recent analyses have suggested a placement of dilophosaurids outside Coelophysoidea, Megaraptora within Tyrannosauroidea, and a paraphyletic Deinonychosauria with troodontids placed more closely to avialans than dromaeosaurids.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Dormice are widely dispersed across various ecosystems in Eurasia and Africa and among the oldest extant rodent lineages. Despite distinct morphological variation to be present between groups, comprehensive morphometrical studies on the dormouse skull are limited. Here, the form of eight out of the nine extant dormouse genera was analysed using 3D geometric morphometrics and linear biomechanical measurements, providing a better understanding of the overall morphological variation present within Gliridae. Species‐, genus‐ and family‐specific morphological trends in both the size and shape of the cranium and mandible are linked with specific habitats and feeding strategies. Smaller dormice show adaptations to a more arboreal lifestyle such as a relatively enlarged braincase and an inferiorly reoriented foramen magnum. Larger dormice show cranial modifications, including clear flattening of the skull and a more posteriorly positioned foramen magnum, hinting towards a more rupicolous lifestyle. Furthermore, specimens inhabiting arid areas appear to have more inflated auditory bullae, whereas other variable features, such as the length of the incisive foramen, were not associated with either size changes or climatic variables. Lastly, more robust and horizontally orientated zygomatic arches as well as increased robusticity of the molar row appear to be linked with herbivory in dormice, whereas thinner arches and small concave molars are seen in more insectivorous species. This study reveals clear convergent adaptations between dormouse species and results in a better understanding of ecological drivers underpinning the morphological divergence present within Gliridae.},

It explores the relationship between open quotient and laryngeal mechanisms, vocal intensity, and fundamental frequency. The audio and electroglottographic signals of 18 classically trained male and female singers were recorded and analyzed with regard to vocal intensity, fundamental frequency, and open quotient. Fundamental frequency and open quotient are derived from the differentiated electroglottographic signal, using the DECOM ?DEgg Correlation-based Open quotient Measurement? method. As male and female phonation may differ in respect to vocal-fold vibratory properties, a distinction is made between two different glottal configurations, which are called laryngeal mechanisms: mechanism 1 ?related to chest, modal, and male head register? and mechanism 2 ?related to falsetto for male and head register for female?. The results show that open quotient depends on the laryngeal mechanisms. It ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 in mechanism 1 and from 0.5 to 0.95 in mechanism 2. The open quotient is strongly related to vocal intensity in mechanism 1 and to fundamental frequency in mechanism 2.},

  abstract = {Accurate muscle reconstructions can offer new information on the anatomy of fossil organisms and are also important for biomechanical analysis (multibody dynamics and finite-element analysis (FEA)). For the sake of simplicity, muscles are often modelled as point-to-point strands or frustra (cut-off cones) in biomechanical models. However, there are cases in which it is useful to model the muscle morphology in three dimensions, to better examine the effects of muscle shape and size. This is especially important for fossil analyses, where muscle force is estimated from the reconstructed muscle morphology (rather than based on data collected               in vivo               ). The two main aims of this paper are as follows. First, we created a new interactive tool in the free open access software Blender to enable interactive three-dimensional modelling of muscles. This approach can be applied to both palaeontological and human biomechanics research to generate muscle force magnitudes and lines of action for FEA. Second, we provide a guide on how to use existing Blender tools to reconstruct distorted or incomplete specimens. This guide is aimed at palaeontologists but can also be used by anatomists working with damaged specimens or to test functional implication of hypothetical morphologies.},

An in-depth statistical analysis reveals the significance as well as the optimal settings of the parameters of the VNS. The algorithm has been implemented in a user-friendly software environment called Optimuse. Optimuse allows a user to input basic characteristics such as length, key and mode. Based on this input, a fifth species counterpoint fragment is generated by the system that can be edited and played back immediately. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Although the effects of body size on mammalian locomotion are well documented, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we present a computational model of the mechanics, control and energetics that unifies some well-known scale effects in running quadrupeds. The model consists of dynamic, physics-based simulations of six running mammals ranging in size from a chipmunk to a horse (0.115-676 kg). The `virtual animals' are made up of rigid segments (head, trunk and four legs) linked by joints and are similar in morphology to particular species. In the model, each stance limb acts as a spring operating within a narrow range of stiffness, forward motion is powered and controlled by active hip and shoulder torques, and metabolic cost is predicted from the time course of supporting body weight. Model parameters that are important for stability (joint stiffnesses,limb-retraction times and target positions and velocities of the limbs) are selected such that (i) running kinematics (aerial height, forward speed and body pitch) is smooth and periodic and (ii) overall leg stiffness is in agreement with published data. Both trotting and galloping gaits are modeled,and comparisons across size are made at speeds that are physiologically similar among species. Model predictions are in agreement with data on vertical stiffness, limb angles, metabolic cost of transport, stride frequency, peak force and duty factor. This work supports the idea that a single, integrative model can predict important features of running across size by employing simple strategies to control overall leg stiffness. More broadly, the model provides a quantitative framework for testing hypotheses that relate limb control, stability and metabolic cost.},

  abstract = {A new control strategy is used to stabilize numerical simulations of a horse model in the trotting quadrupedal gait. Several well-established experimental findings are predicted by the model, including how stride frequency and stride length change with forward running speed. Mass is distributed throughout the model's legs, trunk, and head in a realistic manner. Leg and trunk flexion is modeled using four flexible legs, a back joint, and a neck joint. In the control model, pitch stabilization is achieved without directly controlling body pitch, but rather by controlling both the aerial time and the foot speed of each stance leg. The legs behave as ideal springs while in contact with the ground, enabling the model to rebound from the ground with each trotting step. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the model's capacity to overcome a change in ground impedance. Model stability is maximized and the metabolic cost of trotting is minimized within a narrow range of leg stiffness where trotting horses of similar body size have been observed to operate. This work suggests that a horselike robot will exhibit behavior that is mechanically similar to that of a trotting horse if it operates in a narrow range of leg stiffness and employs simple control strategies where postural stabilization is an emergent property of the system.},

For SOL this period of growth was reflected in an increased muscle mass and PC. No such increases were found for GM. In contrast, immobilization caused severe atrophy of fibres of both muscles. Compared to the value at the start of the immobilization, it was found that the fast twitch muscle (GM) atrophied more than the typically slow twitch one (SOL). The number of sarcomeres in series within fibres increased after growth and decreased after immobilization of SOL. For fibres of GM no such changes were observed. Muscle architecture is proposed as an important factor for the explanation of the results concerning the number of sarcomeres in series and those arranged in parallel. Due to the difference in muscle architecture, GM being more pennate than SOL, during growth, it is thought that increases in bone length affect the length of fibres of SOL more than those of GM. During immobilization, atrophy of fibres of GM was sufficient for the muscle length adaptation to meet the muscle length change induced by immobilization but in SOL, atrophy had to be accompanied by decreases in the number of sarcomeres in series to achieve adequate muscle length adaptation.},

  abstract = {The output of skeletal muscle can be varied by selectively recruiting different motor units. However, our knowledge of muscle function is largely derived from muscle in which all motor units are activated. This discrepancy may limit our understanding of               in vivo               muscle function. Hence, this study aimed to characterize the mechanical properties of muscle with different motor unit activation. We determined the isometric properties and isotonic force–velocity relationship of rat plantaris muscles               in situ               with all of the muscle active, 30\% of the muscle containing predominately slower motor units active or 20\% of the muscle containing predominately faster motor units active. There was a significant effect of active motor unit type on isometric force rise time (               p               {$<$} 0.001) and the force–velocity relationship (               p               {$<$} 0.001). Surprisingly, force rise time was longer and maximum shortening velocity higher when all motor units were active than when either fast or slow motor units were selectively activated. We propose this is due to the greater relative effects of factors such as series compliance and muscle resistance to shortening during sub-maximal contractions. The findings presented here suggest that recruitment according to the size principle, where slow motor units are activated first and faster ones recruited as demand increases, may not pose a mechanical paradox, as has been previously suggested.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether walking at the PSF and FDHO leads to minimal metabolic and mechanical costs. Subjects walked on a level treadmill at the PSF, FDHO, and frequencies above and below. Effects of stride length (SL) and speed (S) were assessed by two conditions, one in which SL was constant and the other in which S was constant. The predictability of PSF from resonance was replicated. Walking at the PSF and FDHO frequencies resulted in metabolic costs which were not significantly different (P {$>$} 0.05). A U-shaped oxygen consumption curve was observed with the minimum at the PSF and FDHO conditions when S was constant. A two-component curve in which a breakpoint was observed was found in the SL constant condition. A significant increase in metabolic cost was observed above the PSF/FDHO (P {$<$} 0.01). Internal work (power) values were not significantly different between walking frequencies for the S constant condition. In the SL constant condition, internal work values showed linear increases as frequency increased. It was concluded that PSF of walking arises from the interface of the resonance properties of the limbs as oscillators and the tendency of biological systems to self-optimize. © 1991 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate a Hill-based mathematical model of muscle energetics and to disclose inconsistencies in existing experimental data. For this purpose, we simulated iso-velocity contractions of mouse fast twitch EDL and slow twitch SOL fibers, and we compared the outcome to experimental results. The experimental results were extracted from two studies published in the literature, which were based on the same methodology but yielded different outcomes (B96 and B93). In the model, energy cost was modeled as the sum of heat and work. Parameters used to model heat rate were entirely independent of the experimental datasets. Parameters describing the mechanical behavior were derived from both experimental studies. The model was found to accurately predict the muscle energetics and mechanical efficiency of data-set B96. The model could not, however, replicate the energetics and efficiency of SOL and EDL that were found in data-set B93. The model overestimated the shortening heat rate of EDL but, surprisingly, also the mechanical work rate for both muscles. This was surprising since mechanical characteristics of the model were derived directly from the experimental data. It was demonstrated that the inconsistencies in data-set B93 must have been due to some unexplained confounding artifact. It was concluded that the presented model of muscle energetics is valid for isovelocity contractions of mammalian muscle since it accurately predicts experimental results of an independent data-set (B96). In addition, the model appeared to be helpful in revealing inconsistencies in a second data-set (B93).},

Hence, this study is based on the reasoning that a jogger would naturally feel most comfortable to run at the stride frequency corresponding to the natural oscillation frequency of his leg. Under this condition, the jogger would be least tired, as the leg muscles would need to do minimal work to accelerate and decelerate the leg at the start and end of the leg-swing phase of the cycle. Thus, the jogging motion of a runner will appear to be natural and smooth. To elucidate if the leg motion frequency corresponding to its natural frequency of oscillation about the hip joint is the most comfortable jogging mode (causing minimal fatigue to the jogger), both analytical and experimental studies were carried out to determine these frequency values. Analytically, the leg was modelled as a double-compound pendulum and the expressions for the natural oscillation frequencies were derived to compute the stride frequencies (SFs) based on the anthropometric parameters of the volunteers. Also, experimentally, the SFs of these volunteers were determined under running conditions, using a 50 Hz video camera and Peak Motus software. The regression analysis of the model-based stride frequencies versus preferred stride frequencies of natural running yielded a remarkably high correlation coefficient of 0.94. The results obtained in this study suggest that jogging at the natural oscillation frequency of the leg may invoke the least expenditure of energy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Terrestrial locomotion on legs is energetically expensive. Compared with cycling, or with locomotion in swimming or flying animals, walking and running are highly uneconomical. Legged gaits that minimise mechanical work have previously been identified and broadly match walking and running at appropriate speeds. Furthermore, the ‘cost of muscle force’ approaches are effective in relating locomotion kinetics to metabolic cost. However, few accounts have been made for why animals deviate from either work-minimising or muscle-force-minimising strategies. Also, there is no current mechanistic account for the scaling of locomotion kinetics with animal size and speed. Here, we report measurements of ground reaction forces in walking children and adult humans, and their stance durations during running. We find that many aspects of gait kinetics and kinematics scale with speed and size in a manner that is consistent with minimising muscle activation required for the more demanding between mechanical work and power: spreading the duration of muscle action reduces activation requirements for power, at the cost of greater work demands. Mechanical work is relatively more demanding for larger bipeds – adult humans – accounting for their symmetrical M-shaped vertical force traces in walking, and relatively brief stance durations in running compared with smaller bipeds – children. The gaits of small children, and the greater deviation of their mechanics from work-minimising strategies, may be understood as appropriate for their scale, not merely as immature, incompletely developed and energetically sub-optimal versions of adult gaits.},

Despite the well-characterized structure of vinculin, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action have remained unclear. Here, using vinculin mutants, we separate the vinculin head and tail regions into distinct functional domains. We show that the vinculin head regulates integrin dynamics and clustering and the tail regulates the link to the mechanotransduction force machinery. The expression of vinculin constructs with unmasked binding sites in the head and tail regions induces dramatic FA growth, which is mediated by their direct interaction with talin. This interaction leads to clustering of activated integrin and an increase in integrin residency time in FAs. Surprisingly, paxillin recruitment, induced by active vinculin constructs, occurs independently of its potential binding site in the vinculin tail. The vinculin tail, however, is responsible for the functional link of FAs to the actin cytoskeleton. We propose a new model that explains how vinculin orchestrates FAs.},

Furthermore, it denotes that the damping energy loss is proportional to the square of the impacting velocity, instead of to its cube, as can be deduced from Goldsmith’s work. A damping term λxnx˙ is here introduced; for a sphere impacting a plate Hertz gives n = 3/2.

  abstract = {We developed a method based on interactive B-spline solids for estimating and visualizing biomechanically important parameters for animal body segments. Although the method is most useful for assessing the importance of unknowns in extinct animals, such as body contours, muscle bulk, or inertial parameters, it is also useful for non-invasive measurement of segmental dimensions in extant animals. Points measured directly from bodies or skeletons are digitized and visualized on a computer, and then a B-spline solid is fitted to enclose these points, allowing quantification of segment dimensions.

I analyzed models of nine theropod dinosaurs (including birds) covering over five orders of magnitude in size. My results uphold previous findings that large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus could not run very quickly, whereas smaller theropods (including some extinct birds) were adept runners. Furthermore, my results strengthen the contention that many nonavian theropods, especially larger individuals, used fairly upright limb orientations, which would have reduced required muscular force, and hence muscle mass. Additional sensitivity analysis of muscle fascicle lengths, moment arms, and limb orientation supports these conclusions and points out directions for future research on the musculoskeletal limits on running ability. Although ankle extensor muscle support is shown to have been important for all taxa, the ability of hip extensor muscles to support the body appears to be a crucial limit for running capacity in larger taxa. I discuss what speeds were possible for different theropod dinosaurs, and how running ability evolved in an inverse relationship to body size in archosaurs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             I used a simple mathematical model of the inverse dynamics of locomotion to estimate the minimum muscle masses required to maintain quasi‐static equilibrium about the four main limb joints at mid‐stance of fast running. Models of 10 extant taxa (a human, a kangaroo, two lizards, an alligator, and five birds) were analyzed in various bipedal poses to examine how anatomy, size, limb orientation, and other model parameters influence running ability. I examined how the muscle masses required for fast running compare to the muscle masses that are actually able to exert moments about the hip, knee, ankle, and toe joints, to see how support ability varies across the limb. I discuss the assumptions and limitations of the models, using sensitivity analysis to see how widely the results differed with feasible parameter input values. Even with a wide range of input values, the models validated the analysis procedure. Animals that are known to run bipedally were calculated as able to preserve quasi‐static equilibrium about their hindlimb joints at mid‐stance, whereas non‐bipedal runners (iguanas and alligators) were recognized as having too little muscle mass to run quickly in bipedal poses. Thus, this modeling approach should be reliable for reconstructing running ability in extinct bipeds such as nonavian dinosaurs. The models also elucidated how key features are important for bipedal running capacity, such as limb orientation, muscle moment arms, muscle fascicle lengths, and body size. None of the animals modeled had extensor muscle masses acting about any one joint that were 7\% or more of their body mass, which provides a reasonable limit for how much muscle mass is normally apportioned within a limb to act about a particular joint. The models consistently showed that a key biomechanical limit on running ability is the capacity of ankle extensors to generate sufficiently large joint moments. Additionally, the analysis reveals how large ratite birds remain excellent runners despite their larger size; they have apomorphically large extensor muscles with relatively high effective mechanical advantage. Finally, I reconstructed the evolution of running ability in the clade Reptilia, showing that the ancestors of extant birds likely were quite capable runners, even though they had already reduced key hip extensors such as M. caudofemoralis longus.

  abstract = {The large theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex underwent remarkable changes during its growth from {$<$}10 kg hatchlings to {$>$}6000 kg adults in {$<$}20 years. These changes raise fascinating questions about the morphological transformations involved, peak growth rates, and scaling of limb muscle sizes as well as the body's centre of mass that could have influenced ontogenetic changes of locomotion in T. rex. Here we address these questions using three-dimensionally scanned computer models of four large, well-preserved fossil specimens as well as a putative juvenile individual. Furthermore we quantify the variations of estimated body mass, centre of mass and segment dimensions, to characterize inaccuracies in our reconstructions. These inaccuracies include not only subjectivity but also incomplete preservation and inconsistent articulations of museum skeletons. Although those problems cause ambiguity, we conclude that adult T. rex had body masses around 6000-8000 kg, with the largest known specimen ("Sue") perhaps ∼9500 kg. Our results show that during T. rex ontogeny, the torso became longer and heavier whereas the limbs became proportionately shorter and lighter. Our estimates of peak growth rates are about twice as rapid as previous ones but generally support previous methods, despite biases caused by the usage of scale models and equations that underestimate body masses. We tentatively infer that the hindlimb extensor muscles masses, including the large tail muscle M. caudofemoralis longus, may have decreased in their relative size as the centre of mass shifted craniodorsally during T. rex ontogeny. Such ontogenetic changes would have worsened any relative or absolute decline of maximal locomotor performance. Regardless, T. rex probably had hip and thigh muscles relatively larger than any extant animal's. Overall, the limb "antigravity" muscles may have been as large as or even larger than those of ratite birds, which themselves have the most muscular limbs of any living animal.},

Fossils reveal that most changes evolved after the divergence of archosaurs in the Triassic, particularly in the dinosaurian precursors to birds. Three-dimensional limb control became concentrated at the hip joint; more distal joints and muscles were restricted to flexion or extension early in dinosaur evolution. Hip extensors expanded even though the primary femoral retractor M. caudofemoralis longus was reduced. Hip flexors and two-joint 'hamstring' muscles were simplified to a few large heads. Knee extensors increased their sizes and moment arms early in bipedal dinosaurs, but the patella and cranial cnemial crest evolved later in birds. Lower limb muscles expanded as ossifications such as the hypotarsus increased their moment arms. The ossification of lower limb tendons, particularly in extensors, is a recent novelty of birds. Muscles and tendons that develop large forces, stresses, and moments to stabilize or move the limbs became increasingly prominent on the line to birds. Locomotion evolved in a stepwise pattern that only recently produced the derived limb control mechanisms of crown-group birds, such as the strongly flexed hip and knee joints. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract = {Summary For centuries, elephant locomotion has been a contentious and confusing challenge for locomotion scientists to understand, not only because of technical difficulties but also because elephant locomotion is in some ways atypical of more familiar quadrupedal gaits. We analyzed the locomotor kinematics of over 2400 strides from 14 African and 48 Asian elephant individuals (body mass 116–4632·kg) freely moving over ground at a 17-fold range of speeds, from slow walking at 0.40·m·s–1 to the fastest reliably recorded speed for elephants, 6.8·m·s–1. These data reveal that African and Asian elephants have some subtle differences in how size-independent kinematic parameters change with speed. Although elephants use a lateral sequence footfall pattern, like many other quadrupeds, they maintain this footfall pattern at all speeds, shifting toward a 25\% phase offset between limbs (singlefoot) as they increase speed. The duty factors of elephants are greater for the forelimbs than for the hindlimbs, so an aerial phase for the hindquarters is reached at slower speeds than for the forequarters. This aerial phase occurs at a Froude number of around 1, matching theoretical predictions. At faster speeds, stance and swing phase durations approach asymptotes, with the duty factor beginning to level off, concurrent with an increase in limb compliance that likely keeps peak forces relatively low. This increase of limb compliance is reflected by increased compression of the hindlimbs. Like other tetrapods, smaller elephants are relatively more athletic than larger ones, but still move very similarly to adults even at {$<$}500·kg. At any particular speed they adopt greater relative stride frequencies and relative stride lengths compared to larger elephants. This extends to near-maximal locomotor performance as well – smaller elephants reach greater Froude numbers and smaller duty factors, hence likely reach relatively greater peak loads on their limbs and produce this force more rapidly. A variety of lines of kinematic evidence support the inference that elephants change their mechanics near a Froude number of 1 (if not at slower speeds), at least to using more compliant limbs, if not spring-like whole-body kinetics. In some ways, elephants move similarly to many other quadrupeds, such as increasing speed mainly by increasing stride frequency (except at fast speeds), and they match scaling predictions for many stride parameters. The main difference from most other animals is that elephants never change their footfall pattern to a gait that uses a wholebody aerial phase. Our large dataset establishes what the normal kinematics of elephant locomotion are, and can also be applied to identify gait abnormalities that may signal musculoskeletal pathologies, a matter of great importance to keepers of captive elephants.},

  abstract = {We developed a three-dimensional, biomechanical computer model of the 36 major pelvic limb muscle groups in an ostrich (Struthio camelus) to investigate muscle function in this, the largest of extant birds and model organism for many studies of locomotor mechanics, body size, anatomy and evolution. Combined with experimental data, we use this model to test two main hypotheses. We first query whether ostriches use limb orientations (joint angles) that optimize the moment-generating capacities of their muscles during walking or running. Next, we test whether ostriches use limb orientations at mid-stance that keep their extensor muscles near maximal, and flexor muscles near minimal, moment arms. Our two hypotheses relate to the control priorities that a large bipedal animal might evolve under biomechanical constraints to achieve more effective static weight support. We find that ostriches do not use limb orientations to optimize the moment-generating capacities or moment arms of their muscles.We infer that dynamic properties ofmuscles or tendons might be better candidates for locomotor optimization. Regardless, general principles explaining why species choose particular joint orientations during locomotion are lacking, raising the question of whether such general principles exist or if clades evolve different patterns (e.g., weighting of muscle force-length or force-velocity properties in selecting postures). This leaves theoretical studies of muscle moment arms estimated for extinct animals at an impasse until studies of extant taxa answer these questions. Finally, we compare our model's results against those of two prior studies of ostrich limb muscle moment arms, finding general agreement for many muscles. Some flexor and extensor muscles exhibit self-stabilization patterns (posture-dependent switches between flexor/extensor action) that ostriches may use to coordinate their locomotion. However, some conspicuous areas of disagreement in our results illustrate some cautionary principles. Importantly, tendon-travel empirical measurements ofmuscle moment arms must be carefully designed to preserve 3D muscle geometry lest their accuracy suffer relative to that of anatomically realistic models. The dearth of accurate experimental measurements of 3D moment arms ofmuscles in birds leaves uncertainty regarding the relative accuracy of different modelling or experimental datasets such as in ostriches. Our model, however, provides a comprehensive set of 3D estimates ofmuscle actions in ostriches for the first time, emphasizing that avian limb mechanics are highly three-dimensional and complex, and how nomuscles act purely in the sagittal plane. A comparative synthesis of experiments and models such as ours could provide powerful synthesis into how anatomy, mechanics and control interact during locomotion and how these interactions evolve. Such a framework could remove obstacles impeding the analysis ofmuscle function in extinct taxa.},

These studies have shown that locomotor neural circuits are distributed in the spinal cord, the midbrain and higher brain regions in vertebrates. The spinal cord plays a key role in locomotor control because it contains central pattern generators (CPGs) – systems of coupled neuronal oscillators that provide coordinated rhythmic control of muscle activation that can be viewed as feedforward controllers – and multiple reflex loops that provide feedback mechanisms. These circuits are activated and modulated by descending pathways from the brain. The relative contributions of CPGs, feedback loops and descending modulation, and how these vary between species and locomotor conditions, remain poorly understood. Robots and neuromechanical simulations can complement experimental approaches by testing specific hypotheses and performing what-if scenarios. This Review will give an overview of key knowledge gained from comparative vertebrate experiments, and insights obtained from neuromechanical simulations and robotic approaches. We suggest that the roles of CPGs, feedback loops and descending modulation vary among animals depending on body size, intrinsic mechanical stability, time required to reach locomotor maturity and speed effects. We also hypothesize that distal joints rely more on feedback control compared with proximal joints. Finally, we highlight important opportunities to address fundamental biological questions through continued collaboration between experimentalists and engineers.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The isometric force–length (F–L) and isotonic force–velocity (F–V) relationships characterize the contractile properties of skeletal muscle under controlled conditions, yet it remains unclear how these properties relate to in vivo muscle function. Here, we map the in situ F–L and F–V characteristics of guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) lateral gastrocnemius (LG) to the in vivo operating range during walking and running. We test the hypothesis that muscle fascicles operate on the F–L plateau, near the optimal length for force (L0) and near velocities that maximize power output (Vopt) during walking and running. We found that in vivo LG velocities are consistent with optimizing power during work production, and economy of force at higher loads. However, LG does not operate near L0 at higher loads. LG length was near L0 at the time of electromyography (EMG) onset but shortened rapidly such that force development during stance occurred on the ascending limb of the F–L curve, around 0.8L0. Shortening across L0 in late swing might optimize potential for rapid force development near the swing–stance transition, providing resistance to unexpected perturbations that require rapid force development. We also found evidence of in vivo passive force rise in late swing, without EMG activity, at lengths where in situ passive force is zero, suggesting that dynamic viscoelastic effects contribute to in vivo force development. Comparison of in vivo operating ranges with F–L and F–V properties suggests the need for new approaches to characterize muscle properties in controlled conditions that more closely resemble in vivo dynamics.},

Professor Johnson first reviews the development of the theory of contact stresses since the problem was originally addressed by H. Hertz in 1882. Next he discusses the influence of friction and the topographical roughness of surfaces, and this is incorporated into the theory of contact mechanics. An important feature is the treatment of bodies which deform plastically or viscoelastically. In addition to stationary contact, an appreciable section of the book is concerned with bodies which are in sliding or rolling contact, or which collide.},

  abstract = {Hemiparesis, defined as unilateral muscle weakness, often occurs in people post-stroke or people with cerebral palsy, however it is difficult to understand how this hemiparesis affects movement patterns as it often presents alongside a variety of other neuromuscular impairments. Predictive musculoskeletal modeling presents an opportunity to investigate how impairments affect gait performance assuming a particular cost function. Here, we use predictive simulation to quantify the spatiotemporal asymmetries and changes to metabolic cost that emerge when muscle strength is unilaterally reduced and how reducing spatiotemporal symmetry affects metabolic cost. We modified a 2-D musculoskeletal model by uniformly reducing the peak isometric muscle force unilaterally. We then solved optimal control simulations of walking across a range of speeds by minimizing the sum of the cubed muscle excitations. Lastly, we ran additional optimizations to test if reducing spatiotemporal asymmetry would result in an increase in metabolic cost. Our results showed that the magnitude and direction of effort-optimal spatiotemporal asymmetries depends on both the gait speed and level of weakness. Also, the optimal speed was 1.25 m/s for the symmetrical and 20\% weakness models but slower (1.00 m/s) for the 40\% and 60\% weakness models, suggesting that hemiparesis can account for a portion of the slower gait speed seen in people with hemiparesis. Modifying the cost function to minimize spatiotemporal asymmetry resulted in small increases (\textasciitilde 4\%) in metabolic cost. Overall, our results indicate that spatiotemporal asymmetry may be optimal for people with hemiparesis. Additionally, the effect of speed and the level of weakness on spatiotemporal asymmetry may help explain the well-known heterogenous distribution of spatiotemporal asymmetries observed in the clinic. Future work could extend our results by testing the effects of other neuromuscular impairments on optimal gait strategies, and therefore build a more comprehensive understanding of the gait patterns observed in clinical populations.},

  abstract = {The New Zealand tuatara, Sphenodon, has a specialized feeding system in which the teeth of the lower jaw close between two upper tooth rows before sliding forward to slice food apart like a draw cut saw. This shearing action is unique amongst living amniotes but has been compared with the chewing power stroke of mammals. We investigated details of the jaw movement using multibody dynamics analysis of an anatomically accurate three-dimensional computer model constructed from computed tomography scans. The model predicts that a flexible symphysis is necessary for changes in the intermandibular angle that permits prooral movement. Models with the greatest symphysial flexibility allow the articulation surface of the articular to follow the quadrate cotyle with the least restriction, and suggest that shearing is accompanied by a long axis rotation of the lower jaws. This promotes precise point loading between the cutting edges of particular teeth, enhancing the effectiveness of the shearing action. Given that Sphenodon is a relatively inactive reptile, we suggest that the link between oral food processing and endothermy has been overstated. Food processing improves feeding efficiency, a consideration of particular importance when food availability is unpredictable. Although this feeding mechanism is today limited to Sphenodon, a survey of fossil rhynchocephalians suggests that it was once more widespread. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In humans, biarticular elements have been identified as one of the reasons for the energy economy of locomotion. This document gives an extensive literature overview concerning the function of biarticular muscles in human beings. The exact role of these muscles in the efficiency of human locomotion is reduced to three elementary functions: energy transfer towards distal joints, efficient control of output force direction and double joint actuation. This information is used to give an insight in the application of biarticular elements in bio-inspired robotics, i.e. bipedal robots, exoskeletons, robotic manipulators and prostheses. Additionally, an attempt is made to find an answer on the question whether the biarticular property leads to a unique contribution to energy efficiency of locomotion, unachievable by mono-articular alternatives. This knowledge is then further utilised to indicate how biarticular actuation of exoskeletons can contribute to an increased performance in reducing user effort.},

Maintaining a balanced energy budget presented a major challenge for therapods, which ranged from the chicken-sized Microraptor up to the whalesized Giganotosaurus, in the face of intense competition and the demands of ontogenetic growth. Facultative scavenging, a behavior present in almost all modern predators, may have been important in supplementing energetically expensive lifestyles. By using agentbased models based on the allometric relationship between size and foraging behaviors, we show that theropods between 27 and 1,044 kg would have gained a significant energetic advantage over individuals at both the small and large extremes of theropod body mass through their scavenging efficiency. These results were robust to rate of competition, primary productivity, and detection distance. Our models demonstrate the potential importance of facultative scavenging in theropods and the role of body size in defining its prevalence in Mesozoic terrestrial systems.},

Postmortem samples were taken from 46 sites in six Thoroughbred horses aged between 3 and 6 years. Fiber type population was determined on muscle fibers stained with monoclonal antibody to each myosin heavy chain isoform and metabolic enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that most of the muscles had a high percentage of Type IIa fibers. In terms of the muscle characteristic in several parts of the horse body, the forelimb muscles had a higher percentage of Type IIa fiber and a significantly lower percentage of Type IIx fiber than the hindlimb muscles. The muscle fiber type populations in the thoracic and trunk portion were similar to those in the hindlimb portion. Biochemical analysis indicated high succinate dehydrogenase activity in respiratory‐related muscle and high phosphofructokinase activity in hindlimbs. We suggested that the higher percentage of Type IIa fibers in Thoroughbred racehorses is attributed to training effects. To consider further the physiological significance of each part of the body, data for the recruitment pattern of each muscle fiber type during exercise are needed. The muscle fiber properties in this study combined with the recruitment data would provide fundamental information for physiological and pathological studies in Thoroughbred horses.

Thus, we created a 3D computational model of underwater walking in extant Japanese giant salamanders (Andrias japonicus) using 3D photogrammetry and open-access graphics software (Blender) to broaden the range of testable hypotheses about the incipient stages of terrestrial locomotion. Our 3D model and software protocol represent the initial stages of an open-access pipeline that could serve as a “one-stop-shop” for studying locomotor function, from creating 3D models to analyzing the mechanics of locomotor gaits. While other pipelines generally require multiple software programs to accomplish the different steps in creating and analyzing computational models of locomotion, our protocol is built entirely within Blender and fully customizable with its Python scripting so users can devote more time to creating and analyzing models instead of navigating the learning curves of several software programs. The main value of our approach is that key kinematic variables (e.g. speed, stride length, and elbow flexion) can be easily altered on the 3D model, allowing scientists to test hypotheses about locomotor function and conduct manipulative experiments (e.g. lengthening bones) that are difficult to perform in vivo. The accurate 3D meshes (and animations) generated through photogrammetry also provide exciting opportunities to expand the abundance and diversity of 3D digital animals available for researchers, educators, artists, conservation biologists, etc. to maximize societal impacts.},

  abstract = {The maximum stresses to which a wide range of mammalian limb tendons could be subjected in life were estimated by considering the relative cross‐sectional areas of each tendon and of the fibres of its muscle. These cross‐sectional areas were derived from mass and length measurements on tendons and muscles assuming published values for the respective densities. The majority of the stresses are low. The distribution has a broad peak with maximum frequency at a stress of about 13 MPa, whereas the fracture stress for tendon in tension is about 100 MPa. Thus, the majority of tendons are far thicker than is necessary for adequate strength. Much higher stresses are found among those tendons which act as springs to store energy during locomotion. The acceptability of low safety factors in these tendons has been explained previously (Alexander, 1981). A new theory explains the thickness of the majority of tendons. The muscle with its tendon is considered as a combined system which delivers mechanical energy: the thickness of the tendon is optimized by minimizing the combined mass. A thinner tendon would stretch more. To take up this stretch, the muscle would require longer muscle fibres, which would increase the combined mass. The predicted maximum stress in a tendon of optimum thickness is about 10 MPa, which is within the main peak of the observed stress distribution. Individual variations from this value are to be expected and can be understood in terms of the functions of the various muscles.},

  abstract = {Differences in limb size and shape are fundamental to mammalian morphological diversity; however, their relevance to locomotor costs has long been subject to debate. In particular, it remains unknown if scale effects in whole limb morphology could partially underlie decreasing mass-specific locomotor costs with increasing limb length. Whole fore- and hindlimb inertial properties reflecting limb size and shape-moment of inertia (MOI), mass, mass distribution, and natural frequency-were regressed against limb length for 44 species of quadrupedal mammals. Limb mass, MOI, and center of mass position are negatively allometric, having a strong potential for lowering mass-specific locomotor costs in large terrestrial mammals. Negative allometry of limb MOI results in a 40\% reduction in MOI relative to isometry's prediction for our largest sampled taxa. However, fitting regression residuals to adaptive diversification models reveals that codiversification of limb mass, limb length, and body mass likely results from selection for differing locomotor modes of running, climbing, digging, and swimming. The observed allometric scaling does not result from selection for energetically beneficial whole limb morphology with increasing size. Instead, our data suggest that it is a consequence of differing morphological adaptations and body size distributions among quadrupedal mammals, highlighting the role of differing limb functions in mammalian evolution. 2015 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

  abstract = {Recently the metabolic cost of swinging the limbs has been found to be much greater than previously thought, raising the possibility that limb rotational inertia influences the energetics of locomotion. Larger mammals have a lower mass-specific cost of transport than smaller mammals. The scaling of the mass-specific cost of transport is partly explained by decreasing stride frequency with increasing body size; however, it is unknown if limb rotational inertia also influences the mass-specific cost of transport. Limb length and inertial properties--limb mass, center of mass (COM) position, moment of inertia, radius of gyration, and natural frequency--were measured in 44 species of terrestrial mammals, spanning eight taxonomic orders. Limb length increases disproportionately with body mass via positive allometry (length ∝ body mass(0.40)); the positive allometry of limb length may help explain the scaling of the metabolic cost of transport. When scaled against body mass, forelimb inertial properties, apart from mass, scale with positive allometry. Fore- and hindlimb mass scale according to geometric similarity (limb mass ∝ body mass(1.0)), as do the remaining hindlimb inertial properties. The positive allometry of limb length is largely the result of absolute differences in limb inertial properties between mammalian subgroups. Though likely detrimental to locomotor costs in large mammals, scale effects in limb inertial properties appear to be concomitant with scale effects in sensorimotor control and locomotor ability in terrestrial mammals. Across mammals, the forelimb's potential for angular acceleration scales according to geometric similarity, whereas the hindlimb's potential for angular acceleration scales with positive allometry.},

Altered activation status of phosphotransfer enzymes and downstream translation factors showed that FAK overexpression was functionally important.

  abstract = {Muscular co-contraction of antagonistic muscle pairs is often observed in human movement, but it is considered inefficient and it can currently not be predicted in simulations where muscular effort or metabolic energy are minimized. Here, we investigated the relationship between minimizing effort and muscular co-contraction in systems with random uncertainty to see if muscular co-contraction can minimize effort in such system. We also investigated the effect of time delay in the muscle, by varying the time delay in the neural control as well as the activation time constant. We solved optimal control problems for a one-degree-of-freedom pendulum actuated by two identical antagonistic muscles, using forward shooting, to find controller parameters that minimized muscular effort while the pendulum remained upright in the presence of noise added to the moment at the base of the pendulum. We compared a controller with and without feedforward control. Task precision was defined by bounding the root mean square deviation from the upright position, while different perturbation levels defined task difficulty. We found that effort was minimized when the feedforward control was nonzero, even when feedforward control was not necessary to perform the task, which indicates that co-contraction can minimize effort in systems with uncertainty. We also found that the optimal level of co-contraction increased with time delay, both when the activation time constant was increased and when neural time delay was added. Furthermore, we found that for controllers with a neural time delay, a different trajectory was optimal for a controller with feedforward control than for one without, which indicates that simulation trajectories are dependent on the controller architecture. Future movement predictions should therefore account for uncertainty in dynamics and control, and carefully choose the controller architecture. The ability of models to predict co-contraction from effort or energy minimization has important clinical and sports applications. If co-contraction is undesirable, one should aim to remove the cause of co-contraction rather than the co-contraction itself.},

A simple body-fluid fish model, representing carangiform locomotion, is developed. Steady swimming at various speeds is analysed using optimal gait theory by minimizing bending moment over tail movements and stiffness, and the results are shown to match with data from observed swimming. Our analysis indicates the following: thrust-drag balance leads to the Strouhal number being predetermined based on the drag coefficient and the ratio of wetted body area to cross-sectional area of accelerated fluid. Muscle tension is reduced when undulation frequency matches resonance frequency, which maximizes the ratio of tail-tip velocity to bending moment. Finally, hydrodynamic resonance determines tail-beat frequency, whereas muscle stiffness is actively adjusted, so that overall body-fluid resonance is exploited. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The mechanical signal(s) that may be important in regulating the number of sarcomeres in series in skeletal muscle fibres or fascicles (sarcomere number) remain(s) speculative, in part because the in vivo mechanical environment of muscle has not yet been defined during sarcomere number perturbations. In the present study, measurements of the in vivo mechanical environment were used to test the hypothesis that increasing muscle excursion results in increased serial sarcomere addition in growing animals. 2. The tibialis anterior (TA) was released from its retinacular restraint at the ankle joint to increase muscle excursion in 4-week-old female New Zealand White rabbits. Twelve weeks post release, muscle excursion and sarcomere number were significantly increased for released TAs compared with control TAs. 3. General cage activity over a 24 h period and in vivo ankle joint kinematics of the experimental leg during hopping on a treadmill were not significantly different between control and release groups, suggesting that altered animal and joint activity patterns were not responsible for the increased serial sarcomere addition associated with TA release. 4. In vivo TA forces during hopping and during a large force-producing foot-flicking motion were significantly decreased in released TAs compared with control TAs. Chronically decreased force production may have been involved in the decreased longitudinal tendon growth observed for the released TA compared with the control TA, which, in turn, may have stimulated the increase in serial sarcomere addition. However, increasing force production of the released TA by partial ablation of the extensor digitorum longus did not inhibit the increase in serial sarcomere addition. 5. The results of this study support the hypothesis that increasing excursion results in increased serial sarcomere addition in growing animals and, when combined with the results of previous studies indicating that decreasing excursion results in decreased serial sarcomere addition, support the working hypothesis that excursion is important in regulating sarcomere number in growing animals.},

The nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside prevented many of the effects of calcium ionophore on C(2)C(12) muscle cells, including preventing talin proteolysis and release into the cytosol and reducing loss of vinculin, cell detachment, and loss of cellular protein. These results indicate that nitric oxide inhibition of calpain protected the cells from ionophore-induced proteolysis. Calpain inhibitor I and a cell-permeable calpastatin peptide also protected the cells from proteolysis, confirming that ionophore-induced proteolysis was primarily calpain mediated. The activity of m-calpain in a casein zymogram was inhibited by sodium nitroprusside, and this inhibition was reversed by dithiothreitol. Previous incubation with the active site-targeted calpain inhibitor I prevented most of the sodium nitroprusside-induced inhibition of m-calpain activity. These data suggest that nitric oxide inhibited m-calpain activity via S-nitrosylation of the active site cysteine. The results of this study indicate that nitric oxide produced endogenously by skeletal muscle and other cell types has the potential to inhibit m-calpain activity and cytoskeletal proteolysis.},

After 4 weeks, the casts were removed, creating a period of rapid sarcomere addition. During the remobilization period, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors or substrate were administered. 3. Rats treated with the non-isoform-specific NOS inhibitor L-nitro-arginine methyl ester during 3 weeks of remobilization had smaller soleus sarcomere numbers than control rats. Rats treated with 1-(2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-imidazole, which has greater specificity for the neuronal isoform than for the endothelial isoform of NOS, also had smaller soleus sarcomere numbers than control rats. These results suggest that inhibition of the neuronal isoform of NOS reduces sarcomere addition during remobilization. 4. Rats treated with L-arginine, the substrate for NOS, during 1 week of remobilization had soleus sarcomere numbers for the immobilized-remobilized muscle which were closer to that for the contralateral, non-immobilized muscle than did rats that were not treated with L-arginine. 5. These results support the hypothesis that nitric oxide derived from the neuronal isoform of NOS positively modulates sarcomere addition.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Relatively recently it has become apparent that providing human kind with a better healthcare requires personalized, predictive and integrative medicine, for which the building of virtual physiological human (VPH) framework accessible via virtual patient avatar is necessary. Real‐time modelling and visual exploration of such a complex avatar is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a real‐time method for automatic modelling of an arbitrarily large number of muscle fibres in the volume of a muscle represented by its surface mesh. The method is based on an iterative morphing of predefined fibres template into the muscle volume exploiting harmonic scalar field computed on the surface of muscle. Experiments with muscles of thighs and pelvis show that the method produces realistic shapes of fibres. Our sequential VTK‐based C++ implementation is capable of producing 64 fine fibres within a muscle of 10K triangles in less than 170 ms on commodity hardware making the method suitable for VPH purposes as well as for interactive educational medical software.},

  abstract = {THE amount of energy used to run a mile is nearly the same whether it is run at top speed or at a leisurely pace (although it is used more rapidly at the higher speed). This puzzling independence of energy cost and speed is found generally among running animals1, although, on a per gram basis, cost is much higher for smaller animals. Running involves little work against the environment2; work is done by muscles and tendons to lift and accelerate the body and limbs. Some of the work is recovered from muscle-tendon springs without metabolic cost3,4 and work rate does not parallel metabolic rate with either speed or size. Regardless of the amount of work muscles do, they must be activated and develop force to support the weight of the body. Load-carrying experiments have shown that the cost of supporting an extra newton of load is the same as the weight-specific cost of running5. Size differences in cost are proportional to stride frequency at equivalent speeds, suggesting that the time available for developing force is important in determining cost6,7. We report a simple inverse relationship between the rate of energy used for running and the time the foot applies force to the ground during each stride. These results support the hypothesis8 that it is primarily the cost of supporting the animal's weight and the time course of generating this force that determines the cost of running.},

MGF is known to stimulate myoblast proliferation and to protect neurons and cardiomyocytes from apoptosis. MGF expression is dramatically increased in response to mechanical stimuli and tissue damage. The mechanisms of induction of MGF expression are as yet imperfectly understood. There is certain evidence that some protein factors able to stimulate MGF synthesis in normal myoblasts are released from damaged muscle. This study was undertaken to explore the nature of these protein inductors of MGF expression and to investigate the mechanism of their action. We report here that myofibrillar fraction of skeletal muscle homogenate activated MGF expression in murine myoblasts and myotubes in culture. The expression of another splice form of IGF-1 gene, IGF-1Ea, was also stimulated by myofibrils. Three myofibrillar proteins able to stimulate MGF synthesis were isolated. These proteins were identified by MALDI and immunoblotting as myomesin, myosin-binding protein C, and titin. The activation of MGF expression was associated with the increase of cAMP level in the cells. Inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase dideoxyadenosine arrested stimulation of MGF synthesis by all three myofibrillar proteins.},

  abstract = {Although clinical bone fractures occur predominately under impact loading (as occurs during sporting accidents, falls, high-speed impacts or other catastrophic events), experimentally validated studies on the dynamic fracture behavior of bone, at the loading rates associated with such events, remain limited. In this study, a series of tests were performed on femoral specimens obtained post-mortem from equine donors ranging in age from 6 months to 28 years. Fracture toughness and compressive tests were performed under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions in order to determine the effects of loading rate and age on the mechanical behavior of the cortical bone. Fracture toughness experiments were performed using a four-point bending geometry on single and doublenotch specimens in order to measure fracture toughness, as well as observe differences in crack initiation between dynamic and quasi-static experiments. Compressive properties were measured on bone loaded parallel and transverse to the osteonal growth direction. Fracture propagation was then analyzed using scanning electron and scanning confocal microscopy to observe the effects of microstructural toughening mechanisms at different strain rates. Specimens from each horse were also analyzed for dry, wet and mineral densities, as well as weight percent mineral, in order to investigate possible influences of composition on mechanical behavior. Results indicate that bone has a higher compressive strength, but lower fracture toughness when tested dynamically as compared to quasistatic experiments. Fracture toughness also tends to decrease with age when measured quasi-statically, but shows little change with age under dynamic loading conditions, where brittle “cleavage-like” fracture behavior dominates.},

  abstract = {We examine two prevailing, yet surprisingly contradictory, theories of human walking. The six determinants of gait are kinematic features of gait proposed to minimize the energetic cost of locomotion by reducing the vertical displacement of the body center of mass (COM). The inverted pendulum analogy proposes that it is beneficial for the stance leg to behave like a pendulum, prescribing a more circular arc, rather than a horizontal path, for the COM. Recent literature presents evidence against the six determinants theory, and a simple mathematical analysis shows that a flattened COM trajectory in fact increases muscle work and force requirements. A similar analysis shows that the inverted pendulum fares better, but paradoxically predicts no work or force requirements. The paradox may be resolved through the dynamic walking approach, which refers to periodic gaits produced almost entirely by the dynamics of the limbs alone. Demonstrations include passive dynamic walking machines that descend a gentle slope, and active dynamic walking robots that walk on level ground. Dynamic walking takes advantage of the inverted pendulum mechanism, but requires mechanical work to transition from one pendular stance leg to the next. We show how the step-to-step transition is an unavoidable energetic consequence of the inverted pendulum gait, and gives rise to predictions that are experimentally testable on humans and machines. The dynamic walking approach provides a new perspective, focusing on mechanical work rather than the kinematics or forces of gait. It is helpful for explaining human gait features in a constructive rather than interpretive manner. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Muscle-actuated control is a research topic that spans multiple domains, including biomechanics, neuroscience, reinforcement learning, robotics, and graphics. This type of control is particularly challenging as bodies are often overactuated and dynamics are delayed and non-linear. It is however a very well tested and tuned actuation mechanism that has undergone millions of years of evolution with interesting properties exploiting passive forces and efficient energy storage of muscle-tendon units. To facilitate research on muscle-actuated simulation, we release a 3D musculoskeletal simulation of an ostrich based on the MuJoCo physics engine. The ostrich is one of the fastest bipeds on earth and therefore makes an excellent model for studying muscle-actuated bipedal locomotion. The model is based on CT scans and dissections used to collect actual muscle data, such as insertion sites, lengths, and pennation angles. Along with this model, we also provide a set of reinforcement learning tasks, including reference motion tracking, running, and neck control, used to infer muscle actuation patterns. The reference motion data is based on motion capture clips of various behaviors that we preprocessed and adapted to our model. This paper describes how the model was built and iteratively improved using the tasks. We also evaluate the accuracy of the muscle actuation patterns by comparing them to experimentally collected electromyographic data from locomoting birds. The results demonstrate the need for rich reward signals or regularization techniques to constrain muscle excitations and produce realistic movements. Overall, we believe that this work can provide a useful bridge between fields of research interested in muscle actuation.},

A notable exception is maximum running speed; the fastest animals are of intermediate size. Here we show that this peculiar allometry results from the competition between two musculoskeletal constraints: the kinetic energy capacity, which dominates in small animals, and the work capacity, which reigns supreme in large animals. The ratio of both capacities defines the physiological similarity index Γ, a dimensionless number akin to the Reynolds number in fluid mechanics. The scaling of Γ indicates a transition from a dominance of muscle forces to a dominance of inertial forces as animals grow in size; its magnitude defines conditions of “dynamic similarity“ that enable comparison and estimates of locomotor performance across extant and extinct animals; and the physical parameters that define it highlight opportunities for adaptations in musculoskeletal “design” that depart from the eternal null hypothesis of geometric similarity. The physiological similarity index challenges the Froude number as prevailing dynamic similarity condition, reveals that the differential growth of muscle and weight forces central to classic scaling theory is of secondary importance for the majority of terrestrial animals, and suggests avenues for comparative analyses of locomotor systems.},

I show that the maximum mechanical output of such contractions is determined by a characteristic dimensionless number, the “effective inertia,”               Γ               , defined by a small set of mechanical, physiological, and anatomical properties of the interrogated musculoskeletal complex. Different musculoskeletal systems with equal               Γ               may be considered physiologically similar, in the sense that maximum performance involves equal fractions of the muscle’s maximum strain rate, strain capacity, work, and power density.

External forces truncate the mechanical performance space accessible to muscle by introducing parasitic losses, and subtly alter how musculoskeletal anatomy modulates muscle performance, challenging canonical notions of skeletal force–velocity trade-offs.               Γ               varies systematically under isogeometric transformations of musculoskeletal systems, a result which provides fundamental insights into the key determinants of animal locomotor performance across scales.},

  abstract = {Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) are exclusively terrestrial, bipedal and cursorial ratites with some similar biomechanical characteristics to humans. Their growth rates are impressive, as their body mass increases eighty-fold from hatching to adulthood whilst maintaining the same mode of locomotion throughout life. These ontogenetic characteristics stimulate biomechanical questions about the strategies that allow emus to cope with their rapid growth and locomotion, which can be partly addressed via scaling (allometric) analysis of morphology. In this study we have collected pelvic limb anatomical data (muscle architecture, tendon length, tendon mass and bone lengths) and calculated muscle physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) and average tendon cross sectional area from emus across three ontogenetic stages (n = 17, body masses from 3.6 to 42 kg). The data were analysed by reduced major axis regression to determine how these biomechanically relevant aspects of morphology scaled with body mass. Muscle mass and PCSA showed a marked trend towards positive allometry (26 and 27 out of 34 muscles respectively) and fascicle length showed a more mixed scaling pattern. The long tendons of the main digital flexors scaled with positive allometry for all characteristics whilst other tendons demonstrated a less clear scaling pattern. Finally, the two longer bones of the limb (tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus) also exhibited positive allometry for length, and two others (femur and first phalanx of digit III) had trends towards isometry. These results indicate that emus experience a relative increase in their muscle forcegenerating capacities, as well as potentially increasing the force-sustaining capacities of their tendons, as they grow. Furthermore, we have clarified anatomical descriptions and provided illustrations of the pelvic limb muscle–tendon units in emus.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYBody mass is the primary determinant of an animal’s energy requirements. At their optimum walking speed, large animals have lower mass-specific energy requirements for locomotion than small ones. In animals ranging in size from 0.8 g (roach) to 260 kg (zebu steer), the minimum cost of transport (COTmin) decreases with increasing body size roughly as COTmin∝body mass (Mb)–0.316±0.023 (95\% CI). Typically, the variation of COTmin with body mass is weaker at the intraspecific level as a result of physiological and geometric similarity within closely related species. The interspecific relationship estimates that an adult elephant, with twice the body mass of a mid-sized elephant, should be able to move its body approximately 23\% cheaper than the smaller elephant. We sought to determine whether adult Asian and sub-adult African elephants follow a single quasi-intraspecific relationship, and extend the interspecific relationship between COTmin and body mass to 12-fold larger animals. Physiological and possibly geometric similarity between adult Asian elephants and sub-adult African elephants caused body mass to have a no effect on COTmin (COTmin∝Mb0.007±0.455). The COTmin in elephants occurred at walking speeds between 1.3 and ∼1.5 m s–1, and at Froude numbers between 0.10 and 0.24. The addition of adult Asian elephants to the interspecific relationship resulted in COTmin∝M–0.277±0.046b. The quasi-intraspecific relationship between body mass and COTmin among elephants caused the interspecific relationship to underestimate COTmin in larger elephants.},

  abstract = {Many inferences on the biology, behaviour and ecology of extinct vertebrates are based on the reconstruction of the musculature and rely considerably on its accuracy. Although the advent of digital reconstruction techniques has facilitated the creation and testing of musculoskeletal hypotheses in recent years, muscle strain capabilities have rarely been considered. Here, a digital modelling approach using the freely available visualization and animation software B               lender               is applied to estimate cranial muscle length changes and optimal and maximal possible gape in different theropod dinosaurs. Models of living archosaur taxa (               Alligator mississippiensis               ,               Buteo buteo               ) were used in an extant phylogenetically bracketed framework to validate the method. Results of this study demonstrate that               Tyrannosaurus rex               ,               Allosaurus fragilis               and               Erlikosaurus andrewsi               show distinct differences in the recruitment of the jaw adductor musculature and resulting gape, confirming previous dietary and ecological assumptions. While the carnivorous taxa               T. rex               and               Allo. fragilis               were capable of a wide gape and sustained muscle force, the herbivorous therizinosaurian               E. andrewsi               was constrained to small gape angles.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Recent advances in computer technology have substantially changed the field of palaeontology in the last two decades. Palaeontologists now have a whole new arsenal of powerful digital techniques available to study fossil organisms in unprecedented detail and to test hypotheses regarding function and behaviour. Multibody dynamics analysis (               MDA               ) is one of these techniques and although it originated as a tool used in the engineering and automotive industry, it holds great potential to address palaeontological questions as well.               MDA               allows the simulation of dynamic movements in complex objects consisting of multiple linked components. As such, this technique is ideally suited to model biological structures and to obtain quantifiable results that can be used to test the function of musculoskeletal systems rigorously. However, despite these advantages,               MDA               has seen a slow uptake by the palaeontological community. The most likely reason for this lies in the steep learning curve and complexity of the method. This paper provides an overview of the underlying principles of               MDA               and outlines the main steps involved in conducting analyses. A number of recent studies using               MDA               to reconstruct the palaeobiology of fossil organisms are presented and the potential for future studies is discussed. Similar to other computational techniques, including finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics, the non‐invasive and exploratory power of               MDA               makes it ideally suited to study the form and function in vertebrates for which no modern analogues exist.},

These concepts are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, so students' understanding of them is vital to mastering the subject. This text makes these concepts more accessible by introducing them early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, developing them gradually, and returning to them throughout the text so that when they are discussed in the abstract, students are readily able to understand},

Further it is posited that systems succeed in minimizing their energy expenditure by moving at this resonant frequency.

Researchers have sought to correlate the preferred strike frequency with the resonant frequencies of the model or used indirect measurement such as oxygen consumption, electromyography (EMG) to assess expended effort. In our study, we employed virtual prototyping with a capable musculoskeletal simulation model to study the same hypothesis. We benchmark against the available literature and demonstrate that valuable insights can be obtained that can complement the current knowledge-base in biped locomotion. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The relationship between mechanical and metabolic behaviour in the widely used Hill muscle-tendon complex (MTC) model is not straightforward, while this is an integral part of the Huxley model. In this study we assessed to what extent Huxley and Hill type MTC models yield adequate predictions of mechanical muscle behaviour during stretch-shortening cycles (SSC). In fully anaesthetized male Wistar rats (N=3), m. soleus was dissected completely free, except for the insertion. Cuff electrodes were placed over the n. ischiadicus. The distal end of the tendon was connected to a servo motor, via a force transducer. The setup allowed for full control over muscle stimulation and length, while force was measured. Quick release and isovelocity contractions (part 1), and SSC (part 2) were imposed. Simulations of part 2 were made with both a Hill and a Huxley MTC model, using parameter values determined from part 1. A modification to the classic two-state Huxley model was made to incorporate series elasticity, activation dynamics and active and passive force-length relations. Results were similar for all rats. Fitting of the free parameters to data of part 1 was near perfect (R2 \&gt; .97). During SSC, predicted peak force and force during relaxation deviated from the experimental data, for both models. Overall, both models yielded similarly adequate predictions of the experimental data. We conclude that Huxley and Hill MTC models are equally valid with respect to mechanical behaviour.},

  abstract = {Sheep are a predominant animal model used to study a variety of orthopedic conditions. Understanding and controlling the in-vivo loading environment in the sheep hind limb is often necessary for investigations relating to bone and joint mechanics. The purpose of this study was to develop a musculoskeletal model of an adult sheep hind limb and investigate the effects of treadmill walking speed on muscle and joint contact forces. We constructed the skeletal geometry of the model from computed topography images. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was utilized to establish the inertial properties of each model segment. Detailed dissection and tendon excursion experiments established the requisite muscle lines of actions. We used OpenSim and experimentally-collected marker trajectories and ground reaction forces to quantify muscle and joint contact forces during treadmill walking at 0.25 m• sÀ1 and 0.75 m• sÀ1. Peak compressive and anterior–posterior tibiofemoral contact forces were 20\% (0.38 BW, p ¼ 0.008) and 37\% (0.17 BW, p ¼ 0.040) larger, respectively, at the moderate gait speed relative to the slower speed. Medial–lateral tibiofemoral contact forces were not significantly different. Adjusting treadmill speed appears to be a viable method to modulate compressive and anterior–posterior tibiofemoral contact forces in the sheep hind limb.

The optimization criterion is as follows; global locations of arbitrary points on the femur as a result of flexion about the fixed axis should approximate as close as possible their positions due to an equivalent anatomical motion. For comparison, an expression for the location and direction of a screw axis describing the same anatomical movement is derived. The techniques were tested by their application to blocks of known geometry. The optimal axis for two different constraint criteria and the screw axis are located in the knee of a human subject for the range of motion of complete extension to approximately 90-deg flexion. The results for the axes are compared with each other and with a commonly utilized internal prosthetic axis on the basis of ligament length patterns obtained by flexion about the different axes.},

However, modern domesticated breeds do not descend from the earliest domestic horse lineage associated with archaeological evidence of bridling, milking and corralling               2–4               at Botai, Central Asia around 3500               bc               3               . Other longstanding candidate regions for horse domestication, such as Iberia               5               and Anatolia               6               , have also recently~been challenged. Thus, the genetic, geographic and temporal origins of modern domestic horses have remained unknown. Here we pinpoint the Western Eurasian steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don region, as the homeland of modern domestic horses. Furthermore, we map the population changes accompanying domestication from 273 ancient horse genomes. This reveals that modern domestic horses ultimately replaced almost all other local populations as they expanded rapidly across Eurasia from about 2000               bc               , synchronously with equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle architecture is the structural property of whole muscles that dominates their function. This review describes the basic architectural properties of human upper and lower extremity muscles. The designs of various muscle groups in humans and other species are analyzed from the point of view of optimizing function. Muscle fiber arrangement and motor unit arrangement is discussed in terms of the control of movement. Finally, the ability of muscles to change their architecture in response to immobilization, eccentric exercise, and surgical tendon transfer is reviewed. Future integrative physiological studies will provide insights into the mecha- nisms by which such adaptations occur. It is likely that muscle fibers trans- duce both stress and strain and respond by modifying sarcomere number in a way more suited to the new biomechanical environment.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the chronic effects of a static stretching program on the muscle architecture of biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in ultrasound (US) images. Design: Randomized controlled longitudinal trial. Setting: Biomechanics Laboratory of Physical Education School of the Army, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Participants: The study included 24 healthy and physically active male volunteers (19.05 +/- 1.40 years, 1.73 +/- 0.07 m, and 73.15 +/- 8.33 kg), randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: stretching group (SG, n = 12) and control group (n = 12). Interventions: The SG was submitted to 3 sets of 30 seconds of static stretching 3 times a week during 8 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Ultrasound equipment (7.5 MHz) was used for the evaluation of BF and VL muscle architecture variables (pennation angle, fiber length, muscle thickness, and fascicle displacement) before and after training. Knee range of motion (ROM) and isometric flexion and extension torque (TQ) were also measured. Results: There were no significant changes in muscle architecture, TQ, and maximum knee flexion angle (P {$>$} 0.05). However, maximum knee extension angle (MEA) increased significantly in the SG (pretraining: 159.37 +/- 7.27 degrees and posttraining: 168.9 +/- 3.7 degrees; P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: Volume or intensity (or both) of the stretching protocol was insufficient to cause structural changes in the VL and BF muscles. The increase in MEA could not be explained by muscle architecture changes. Clinical Relevance: To describe changes in the VL and BF muscle tendon unit using US after a long-term stretching program to identify which structures are responsible for ROM increase.},

In this study, cores of trabecular bone and thin slices of bone from the calcar were obtained from the femoral neck of patients with OA or OP following hip arthroplasty and a normal group post mortem. The mechanical properties, densities and material composition were measured. The aim was to determine whether differences in these properties could explain why osteoarthritic patients did not suffer from fractured neck of femur. No difference was found in the density or stiffness of the calcar between the groups, though there appeared to be a small increase in mineralization in the OA bone compared with the OP. However, there was a 72\% increase in the volume of trabecular bone in the OA group compared with a loss of about 20\% in the OP group. This increased apparent density of the OA trabecular bone resulted in a greater stiffness, yield strength and energy absorbed to yield, whereas the same properties of OP bone were not significantly lower than normal. These marked changes in the OA bone could result in a redistribution of stresses due to loads caused by falling, thereby absorbing the energy of impact and preventing the formation of a fracture surface.},

The voice source in bass-type throat singing was studied in one male singer. The subject alternated between modal voice and the throat singing mode. Vocal fold vibrations were observed with high-speed photography, using a computerized recording system. The spectral characteristics of the sound signal were analyzed. Kymographic image data were compared to the sound signal and flow inverse filtering data from the same singer were obtained on a separate occasion. It was found that the vocal folds vibrated at the same frequency throughout both modes of singing. During throat singing the ventricular folds vibrated with complete but short closures at half the frequency of the true vocal folds, covering every second vocal fold closure. Kymographic data confirmed the findings. The spectrum contained added subharmonics compared to modal voice. In the inverse filtered signal the amplitude of every second airflow pulse was considerably lowered. The ventricular folds appeared to modulate the sound by reducing the glottal flow of every other vocal fold vibratory cycle.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial animals not only need to walk and run but also lie prone to rest and then stand up. Sit-to-stand (STS) and sit-to-walk (STW) transitions are vital behaviours little studied in species other than humans so far, but likely impose biomechanical constraints on limb design because they involve near-maximal excursions of limb joints that should require large length changes and force production from muscles. By integrating data from experiments into musculoskeletal simulations, we analysed joint motions, ground reaction forces, and muscle dynamics during STS and STW in a large terrestrial, bipedal, and cursorial bird: the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae, ∼30 kg). Simulation results suggest that in both STS and STW, emus operate near the functional limits (∼50 \% of shortening/lengthening) of some of their hindlimb muscles, particularly in distal muscles with limited capacity for length change and leverage. Both movements involved high muscle activations (\&gt; 50 \%) and force generation of the major joint extensor muscles early in the transition. STW required larger net joint moments and non-sagittal motions than STS, entailing greater demands for muscle capacity. Whilst our study involves multiple assumptions, our findings lay the groundwork for future studies to understand, for example, how tendon contributions may reduce excessive muscle demands, especially in the distal hindlimb. As the first investigation into how an avian species stands up, this study provides a foundational framework for future comparative studies investigating organismal morphofunctional specialisations and evolution, offering potential robotics and animal welfare applications.},

The pattern of body oscillation (gait) can be mimicked from animals, but understanding the principles underlying gait generation would allow for broad, flexible applications beyond nature's design. We hypothesise that travelling-wave oscillations observed in undulatory locomotion can be characterised as a natural oscillation of the locomotion dynamics and propose a formal definition of the natural gait for locomotion systems. We identify the essential dynamics and define the mode shape of natural oscillation by the free response of an idealised system. We then use body-environment resonance to define the amplitude and frequency. Explicit formulas for the natural gait are derived to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying undulatory locomotion. Examples of a swimming leech and a fictitious swimmer illustrate how undulatory gaits similar to those observed can be produced as the natural gait and modulated to achieve different swim speeds.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             Previous studies have focused on documenting shape variation in the caudal vertebrae in chameleons underlying prehensile tail function. The goal of this study was to test the impact of this variation on tail function using multibody dynamic analysis (MDA). First, observations from dissections and 3D reconstructions generated from contrast-enhanced µCT scans were used to document regional variation in arrangement of the caudal muscles along the antero-posterior axis. Using MDA, we then tested the effect of vertebral shape geometry on biomechanical function. To address this question, four different MDA models were built: those with a distal vertebral shape and with either a distal or proximal musculature, and reciprocally the proximal vertebral shape with either the proximal or distal musculature. For each muscle configuration, we calculated the force required in each muscle group for the muscle force to balance an arbitrary external force applied to the model. The results showed that the models with a distal-type of musculature are the most efficient, regardless of vertebral shape. Our models also showed that the m. ilio-caudalis pars dorsalis is least efficient when combining the proximal vertebral shape and distal musculature, highlighting the importance of the length of the transverse process in combination with the lever-moment arm onto which muscle force is exerted. This initial model inevitably has a number of simplifications and assumptions, however its purpose is not to predict in vivo forces, but instead reveals the importance of vertebral shape and muscular arrangement on the total force the tail can generate, thus providing a better understanding of the biomechanical significance of the regional variations on tail grasping performance in chameleons.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in assistive exoskeletons; both passive and active devices have reduced metabolic costs near preferred walking speed by assisting muscle actions. Metabolic reductions at multiple speeds should thus also be attainable. Musculoskeletal simulation can potentially predict the interaction between assistive moments, muscle-tendon mechanics, and walking energetics. In this study, we simulated devices’ optimal assistive moments based on minimal muscle activations during walking with prescribed kinematics and dynamics. We used a generic musculoskeletal model with tuned muscle-tendon parameters and computed metabolic rates from muscle actions. We then simulated walking across multiple speeds and with two ideal actuation modes–motor-based and spring-based–to assist ankle plantarflexion, knee extension, hip flexion, and hip abduction and compared computed metabolic rates. We found that both actuation modes considerably reduced physiological joint moments but did not always reduce metabolic rates. Compared to unassisted conditions, motor-based ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion assistance reduced metabolic rates, and this effect was more pronounced as walking speed increased. Spring-based hip flexion and abduction assistance increased metabolic rates at some walking speeds despite a moderate decrease in some muscle activations. Both modes of knee extension assistance reduced metabolic rates to a small extent, even though the actuation contributed with practically the entire net knee extension moment during stance. Motor-based hip abduction assistance reduced metabolic rates more than spring-based assistance, though this reduction was relatively small. Our study also suggests that an assistive strategy based on minimal muscle activations might result in a suboptimal reduction of metabolic rates. Future work should experimentally validate the effects of assistive moments and refine modeling assumptions accordingly. Our computational workflow is freely available online.},

  abstract = {Abstract             It is accepted that non-avian theropod dinosaurs, with their long muscular tails and small forelimbs, had a centre-of-mass close to the hip, while extant birds, with their reduced tails and enlarged wings have their mass centred more cranially. Transition between these states is considered crucial to two key innovations in the avian locomotor system: crouched bipedalism and powered flight. Here we use image-based models to challenge this dichotomy. Rather than a phylogenetic distinction between ‘dinosaurian’ and ‘avian’ conditions, we find terrestrial versus volant taxa occupy distinct regions of centre-of-mass morphospace consistent with the disparate demands of terrestrial bipedalism and flight. We track this decoupled evolution of body shape and mass distribution through bird evolution, including the origin of centre-of-mass positions more advantageous for flight and major reversions coincident with terrestriality. We recover modularity in the evolution of limb proportions and centre-of-mass that suggests fully crouched bipedalism evolved after powered flight.},

  abstract = {Locomotion is essential to the survival of all organisms. Extant animals display a broad range of adaptations to a wide range of locomotor behaviours. Locomotion can be observed directly in living animals, but this is not the case for fossil taxa which are known from only skeletal material. An indirect route is therefore required to access this information on locomotor capabilities. Centre of mass is a key biomechanical parameter which effectively summarises body shape. Body shape influences, and is influenced by, the locomotor capabilities of an organism. Due to these close links, centre of mass has considerable potential value as an indirect route to information on locomotion in extinct species. One group of particular interest is Archosauria, which contains a host of unusual animals such as Diplodocus, Pterodactylus and Tyrannosaurus. However, there are several obstacles which currently prevent centre of mass being used to its full potential in investigations of fossil taxa. Firstly, existing methods for estimating centre of mass position in fossils are limited either by substantial subjectivity, or by a lack of data on extant archosaurs. Additionally, the interpretation of any resulting predictions of centre of mass is hindered by a poor understanding of the links between centre of mass and specific locomotor behaviours, especially in volant organisms. It is therefore recognised that in order for the field to progress, more data are required on extant archosaurs. This thesis seeks to address this issue by collecting a series of novel datasets on living archosaurs which are used as the foundation for improved predictions and interpretations of centre of mass data in extinct archosaurs. Three commonly used methods for centre of mass estimation in physical specimens were assessed in order to determine their absolute accuracies. The scales and digital methods were found to have high levels of accuracy and repeatability. Due to method specific limitations when applied to biological specimens, I concluded that the digital method is the preferred solution for this thesis. One benefit of digital modelling is the ease of alteration; small details can be added to models, but this is a time consuming process. This thesis examined the impact of different levels of model detail on whole body centre of mass. For example, air cavities (included as standard in current models), were found to exert less influence on centre of mass than a feathered integument (which has never before been quantified), calling standard modelling practices into question. Using digital models of 27 bird species, links were explored between centre of mass position and locomotor type. Species using volant behaviours were found to have more ventral centres of mass than their terrestrial counterparts; though this difference was not significant after accounting for phylogeny. This would provide greater manoeuvrability in flight. Finally, a new method for centre of mass estimation in fossils was developed and applied to fossil taxa. Compared to previous work, this method produced different centres of mass, with greater error margins. This is despite the fact that this new method benefits from greater objectivity and a quantitative grounding based on data from extant archosaurs. This suggests that previous studies have underestimated the biological variation present and their results should therefore be interpreted with caution. This thesis provides the foundation for further work to continue to build towards better methods for centre of mass estimation in extinct taxa, and more confident biological interpretations of the resulting predictions.},

  abstract = {1. The aim of the present study was to measure the mechanical properties of human tibialis anterior (TA) tendon in vivo. 2. Measurements were taken in five males at the neutral ankle position and involved: (a) isometric dynamometry upon increasing the voltage of percutaneous electrical stimulation of the TA muscle, (b) real-time ultrasonography for measurements of the TA tendon origin displacement during contraction and tendon cross-sectional area, and (c) magnetic resonance imaging for estimation of the TA tendon length and moment arm. 3. From the measured joint moments and estimated moment arms, the values of tendon force were calculated and divided by cross-sectional area to obtain stress values. The displacements of the TA tendon origin from rest to all contraction intensities were normalized to tendon length to obtain strain values. From the data obtained, the tendon force-displacement and stress-strain relationships were determined and the tendon stiffness and Young's modulus were calculated. 4. Tendon force and stress increased curvilinearly as a function of displacement and strain, respectively. The tendon force and displacement at maximum isometric load were 530 N and 4.1 mm, and the corresponding stress and strain values were 25 MPa and 2.5\%, respectively. The tendon stiffness and Young's modulus at maximum isometric load were 161 N mm-1 and 1.2 GPa, respectively. These results are in agreement with previous reports on in vitro testing of isolated tendons and suggest that under physiological loading the TA tendon operates within the elastic 'toe' region.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Most studies examining changes in mechanical performance in animals across size have typically focused on inter-specific comparisons across large size ranges. Scale effects, however, can also have important consequences in vertebrates as they increase in size and mass during ontogeny. The goal of this study was to examine how growth and development in the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) hindlimb skeleton reflects the demands placed upon it by ontogenetic changes in locomotor mechanics and body mass. Bone strain patterns in the femur and tibiotarsus (TBT) were related to ontogenetic changes in limb kinematics, ground reaction forces, and ontogenetic scaling patterns of the cross-sectional bone geometry, curvature and mineral ash content over a 4.4-fold increase in leg length and 65-fold increase in mass. Although the distribution of principal and axial strains remained similar in both bones over the ontogenetic size range examined, principal strains on the cranial femur and caudal femur and TBT increased significantly during growth. The ontogenetic increase in principal strains in these bones was likely caused by isometry or only slight positive allometry in bone cross-sectional geometry during growth, while relative limb loading remained similar. The growth-related increase in bone strain magnitude was likely mitigated by increased bone mineralization and decreased curvature. Throughout most of ontogeny, shear strains dominated loading in both bones. This was reflected in the nearly circular cross-sectional geometry of the femur and TBT, suggesting selection for resistance to high torsional loads, as opposed to the more eccentric cross-sectional geometries often associated with the bending common to tetrapods with parasagittal limb orientations, for which in vivobone strains have typically been measured to date.},

Without rigorous criteria for evaluating joint articulation, however, such analyses risk misleading reconstructions of vertebrate animal motion. Here we propose an approach for synthesizing raycast-based measurements of 3-D articular overlap, symmetry, and congruence into a quantitative “articulation score” for any non-interpenetrating six-degree-of-freedom joint configuration. We apply our methodology to bicondylar hindlimb joints of two extant dinosaurs (guineafowl, emu) and, through comparison with in vivo kinematics, find that locomotor joint poses consistently have high articulation scores. We then exploit this relationship to constrain reconstruction of a pedal walking stride cycle for the extinct dinosaur               Deinonychus antirrhopus               , demonstrating the utility of our approach. As joint articulation is investigated in more living animals, the framework we establish here can be expanded to accommodate additional joints and clades, facilitating improved understanding of vertebrate animal motion and its evolution.},

However, joint mobility must be considered in three dimensions simultaneously, and applications of mobility data to extinct taxa require both a phylogenetically informed reconstruction of articular morphology and justifications for why specific structures' effects on mobility are inferred to be similar. We manipulated cadaveric hip joints of common quail and recorded biplanar fluoroscopic videos to measure a ‘ligamentous’ range of motion (ROM), which was then compared to an ‘osteological’ ROM on a ROM map. Nearly 95\% of the joint poses predicted to be possible at the hip based on osteological manipulation were rendered impossible by ligamentous constraints. Because the hip joint capsule reliably includes a ventral ligamentous thickening in extant diapsids, the hip abduction of extinct ornithodirans with an offset femoral head and thin articular cartilage was probably similarly constrained by ligaments as that of birds. Consequently, in the absence of extraordinary evidence to the contrary, our analysis casts doubt on the ‘batlike’ hip pose traditionally inferred for pterosaurs and basal maniraptorans, and underscores that reconstructions of joint mobility based on manipulations of bones alone can be misleading.},

  abstract = {Tracks can potentially offer unique sources of information, providing insight into the environments, gait and posture, locomotion and behaviour. Track preservation can yield important information on substrate consistency and enable the recognition of transmitted subsurface tracks. The ability to recognize transmitted tracks has broad implications for the understanding of palaeoenvironments and interpretation of ichnological assemblages. In order to gain an understanding of how tracks are formed in three dimensions, and of their variability of expression in different substrates, controlled laboratory simulations were undertaken. Experiments were designed to recover subsurface track layers, yielding for the first time detailed information on subsurface morphology that could be related to 'true' surface track features. It was found that subsurface track relief can be correlated with the magnitude and distribution (across a foot) of load acting on the surface sediment. This pressure is transmitted through the sediment, and deforms successive layers at depth, producing an undertrack. The most significant factor controlling track morphology, whether surface or subsurface, was found to be the moisture/density relationship within the substrate at the time of track formation. Variability in the dimensions of simulated tracks, relative to the 'true' surface track, indicates that caution should be exercised when using fossil tracks to calculate hip height, speed, age, and population dynamics. In addition, comparison of experimental tracks with dinosaur tracks from the Yorkshire coast suggests that many morphological differences between vertebrate ichnotaxa reflect sediment rheology and taphonomy rather than taxonomy of the track-maker. © The Geological Society of London.}

  abstract = {Background: Using Froude numbers (Fr) and relative stride length (stride length: hip height), trackways have been widely used to determine the speed and gait of an animal. This approach, however, is limited by the ability to estimate hip height accurately and by the lack of information related to the substrate properties when the tracks were made, in particular for extinct fauna. By studying the Svalbard ptarmigan moving on snow, we assessed the accuracy of trackway predictions from a species-specific model and two additional Fr based models by ground truthing data extracted from videos as the tracks were being made. Results: The species-specific model accounted for more than 60\% of the variability in speed for walking and aerial running, but only accounted for 19\% when grounded running, likely due to its stabilizing role while moving faster over a changing substrate. The error in speed estimated was 0-35\% for all gaits when using the species-specific model, whereas Fr based estimates produced errors up to 55\%. The highest errors were associated with the walking gait. The transition between pendular to bouncing gaits fell close to the estimates using relative stride length described for other extant vertebrates. Conversely, the transition from grounded to aerial running appears to be species specific and highly dependent on posture and substrate. Conclusion: Altogether, this study highlights that using trackways to derive predictions on the locomotor speed and gait, using stride length as the only predictor, are problematic as accurate predictions require information from the animal in question.},

  abstract = {The kinetic properties of muscle that could influence locomotor frequency include rate of activation, rate of cross-bridge "attachment", intrinsic shortening velocity, and rate of deactivation. The latter two mechanisms are examined using examples from high-speed running in lizards and escape swimming in scallops. During running, inertial loading and elastic energy storage probably mitigate the effects of thermal alterations in intrinsic muscle shortening velocity. The result is a rather low thermal dependence of stride frequency over a 15-20 degree C temperature range. However, at lower temperatures, the longer times required for deactivation cause the thermal dependence of frequency to increase greatly. Scallops use a single muscle to swim by jet propulsion. In vivo shortening velocity in these animals also shows a low thermal dependence. As with high-speed running, the mechanics of jet propulsion may limit the effects of thermally induced changes in intrinsic shortening velocity. The largest thermal effect during swimming is on the initial phase of valve opening. The effects of temperature on the rate of deactivation of the adductor muscle could play an important role in limiting reextension of the muscle, which is dependent on elastic energy storage in the hinge ligament. These examples illustrate that the relative importance of various intrinsic contractile properties in controlling locomotor performance depends on the mechanics of the movements.},

  abstract = {Summary             The material properties of a tendon affect its ability to store and return elastic energy, resist damage, provide mechanical feedback, and amplify or attenuate muscle power. While the structural properties of tendon are known to respond to a variety of stimuli, the extent to which material properties vary among individual muscles remains unclear. We studied the tendons of six different muscles in the hindlimb of Eastern wild turkeys to determine if there was variation in elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and resilience. A hydraulic testing machine was used to measure tendon force during quasi-static lengthening, and a stress strain curve was constructed. There was substantial variation in tendon material properties among different muscles. Average elastic modulus differed significantly between some tendons, and values for the six different tendons varied nearly two-fold, from 829±140 to 1479±106 MPa. Tendons were stretched to failure, and the stress at failure, or ultimate tensile stress, was taken as a lower-limit estimate of tendon strength. Breaking tests for four of the tendons revealed significant variation in ultimate tensile stress, ranging from 66.83±14.34 MPa to 112.37±9.39 MPa. Resilience, or the fraction of energy returned in cyclic length changes was generally high, and one of the four tendons tested was significantly different in resilience than the other tendons (range: 90.65±0.83 to 94.02±0.71). An analysis of correlation between material properties revealed a positive relationship between ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus (R2=0.79). Specifically, stiffer tendons were stronger, and we suggest that this correlation results from a constrained value of breaking strain, which did not vary significantly among tendons. This finding suggests an interdependence of material properties that may have a structural basis and may explain some adaptive responses observed in studies of tendon plasticity.},

  abstract = {Metabolic cost minimization is thought to underscore the neural control of locomotion. Yet, avoiding high muscle activation, a cause of fatigue, often outperforms energy minimization in computational predictions of human gait. Discerning the relative importance of these criteria in human walking has proved elusive, in part, because they have not been empirically decoupled. Here, we explicitly decouple whole-body metabolic cost and ‘fatigue-like' muscle activation costs (estimated from electromyography) by pitting them against one another using two distinct gait tasks. When experiencing these competing costs, participants (               n               = 10) chose the task that avoided overburdening muscles (fatigue avoidance) at the expense of higher metabolic power (               p               {$<$} 0.05). Muscle volume-normalized activation more closely models energy use and was also minimized by the participants' decision (               p               {$<$} 0.05), demonstrating that muscle activation was, at best, an inaccurate signal for metabolic energy. Energy minimization was only observed when there was no adverse effect on muscle activation costs. By decoupling whole-body metabolic and muscle activation costs, we provide among the first empirical evidence of humans embracing non-energetic optimality in favour of a clearly defined neuromuscular objective. This finding indicates that local muscle fatigue and effort may well be key factors dictating human walking behaviour and its evolution.},

Previously, several groups identified nebulin as the prime candidate molecule for functioning as a "ruler" to specify the precise lengths of the actin (thin) filaments in skeletal muscle, yet this proposal has never been proven. This article reviews the evidence implicating nebulin as a thin filament ruler, including the most recent studies highlighting its potentially extensive isoform diversity and exciting reports revealing its expression in cardiac tissue. Also examined are novel findings indicating that nebulin is actually a multifunctional filament system, perhaps playing roles in signal transduction, contractile regulation, and myofibril force generation; these ideas are especially intriguing given the growing number of mutations in this giant molecule that are associated with human myopathies. ?? 2003, Elsevier Inc.},

Study Design This is a case-control study. Methods Twenty singers were recorded singing sustained vowels in a “belting” quality refined by audio perception as “Overdrive” and “Edge.” Two studies were performed: (1) a laryngostroboscopic examination using a videonasoendoscopic camera system (Olympus) and the Laryngostrobe program (Laryngograph); (2) a simultaneous recording of the EGG and acoustic signals using Speech Studio (Laryngograph). The images were analyzed based on consensus agreement. Statistical analysis of the acoustic, LTAS, and EGG parameters was undertaken using the Student paired t test. Results The two modes of singing determined by audio perception have visibly different laryngeal gestures: Edge has a more constricted setting than that of Overdrive, where the ventricular folds seem to cover more of the vocal folds, the aryepiglottic folds show a sharper edge in Edge, and the cuneiform cartilages are rolled in anteromedially. LTAS analysis shows a statistical difference, particularly after the ninth harmonic, with a coinciding first formant. The combined group showed statistical differences in shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, normalized noise energy, and mean sound pressure level (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusion “Belting” sounds can be categorized using audio perception into two modes of singing: “Overdrive” and “Edge.” This study demonstrates consistent visibly different laryngeal gestures between these modes and with some correspondingly significant differences in LTAS, EGG, and acoustic measures.},

Existing hypotheses usually connect digit reduction in horses to the spread and eventual dominance of open-habitat grasslands, which took over from forests during the Cenozoic; digit reduction has been argued to be an adaptation for speed, locomotor economy, stability, and/or increased body size. In this review, we assess the evidence for these (not necessarily mutually exclusive) hypotheses from a variety of related fields, including paleoecology, phylogenetic comparative methods, and biomechanics. Convergent evolution of digit reduction, including in litopterns and artiodactyls, is also considered. We find it unlikely that a single evolutionary driver was responsible for the evolution of monodactyly, because changes in body size, foot posture, habitat, and substrate are frequently found to influence one another (and to connect to broader potential drivers, such as changing climate). We conclude with suggestions for future research to help untangle the complex dynamics of this remarkable morphological change in extinct horses. A path forward should combine regional paleoecology studies, quantitative biomechanical work, and make use of convergence and modern analogs to estimate the relative contributions of potential evolutionary drivers for digit reduction.},

At any one speed, the stiffness may be reduced in a controlled fashion by running with the knees bent more than usual. In a series of experiments, subjects ran in both normal and flexed postures on a treadmill. In other experiments, they ran down a runway and over a force platform. Results show that running with the knees bent reduces the effective vertical stiffness and diminishes the transmission of mechanical shock from the foot to the skull but requires an increase of as much as 50\% in the rate of O2 consumption. A new dimensionless parameter (u omega 0/g) is introduced to distinguish between hard and soft running modes. Here, omega 0 is the natural frequency of a mass-spring system representing the body, g is gravity, and u is the vertical landing velocity. In normal running, this parameter is near unity, but in deep-flexed running, where the aerial phase of the stride cycle almost disappears, u omega 0/g approaches zero.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The running gaits used by both bipedal and quadrupedal animals are reviewed and contrasted. At high speeds, bipeds use both ordinary running, in which the legs move opposite one another, and hopping. Quadrupeds generally use the trot or its variations at moderate speeds, and first the canter and then the gallop as speed increases. Running in both bipeds and quadrupeds generally involves at least one aerial phase per stride cycle, but certain perturbations to running including running in circles, running under enhanced gravity, running on compliant surfaces and running with increased knee flexion (Groucho running) can reduce the aerial phase, even to zero.             A conceptual model of running based on the idea that an animal rebounds from the ground like a resonant mass-spring system may be used to compare the various gaits. The model makes specific predictions which show that galloping is generally faster than cantering, pronking or trotting, and requires lower peak vertical forces on the legs while also giving a smoother ride. Even so, trotting might be preferred to galloping at low and moderate speeds for the same reason that normal running is preferred to Groucho running - the more compliant gait offers a smoother ride and lower vertical ground-reaction forces on the feet, but this can only be obtained at a high cost of increased metabolic power.},

This result and the result requiring animal proportions to change with size amount to a derivation of Kleiber's law, a statement only empirical until now, correlating the metabolically related variables with body weight raised to the ¾ power. In the present model, biological frequencies are predicted to go inversely as body weight to the ¼; power, and total body surface areas should correlate with body weight to the ⅝ power. All predictions of the proposed model are tested by comparison with existing data, and the fit is considered satisfactory.                                         In               The Fire of Life,               Kleiber (               5               ) wrote "When the concepts concerned with the relation of body size and metabolic rate are clarified, . . . then compartive physiology of metabolism will be of great help in solving one of the most intricate and interesting problems in biology, namely the regulation of the rate of cell metabolism." Although Hill (               23               ) realized that "the essential point about a large animal is that its structure should be capable of bearing its own weight and this leaves less play for other factors," he was forced to use an oversimplified "geometric similarity" hypothesis in his important work on animal locomotion and muscular dynamics. It is my hope that the model proposed here promises useful answers in comparisons of living things on both the microscopic and the gross scale, as part of the growing science of form, which asks precisely how organisms are diverse and yet again how they are alike.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscles are diverse in their properties, with specific contractile characteristics being matched to particular functions. In this study, published values of contractile properties for {$>$}130 diverse skeletal muscles were analyzed to detect common elements that account for variability in shortening velocity and force production. Body mass was found to be a significant predictor of shortening velocity in terrestrial and flying animals, with smaller animals possessing faster muscles. Although previous studies of terrestrial mammals revealed similar trends, the current study indicates that this pattern is more universal than previously appreciated. In contrast, shortening velocity in muscles used for swimming and nonlocomotory functions is not significantly affected by body size. Although force production is more uniform than shortening velocity, a significant correlation with shortening velocity was detected in muscles used for locomotion, with faster muscles tending to produce more force. Overall, the contractile properties of skeletal muscles are conserved among phylogenic groups, but have been significantly influenced by other factors such as body size and mode of locomotion.},

For that purpose, the geometry of m. quadriceps femoris was modeled in considerable detail, and all parameter values were determined on one set of cadaver specimens that had been selected for muscular appearance. The predicted relationship was compared to that measured in human subjects over the full range of physiological knee angles, and a good correspondence was found (               r               = .96). The good correspondence could be attributed to the substitution of realistic parameter values into the model. Incorporating complex muscle geometry into the model resulted in a small additional improvement of the prediction.

This analysis method allowed comparison of data from left and right fore‐ and hind‐limbs within and between horses. The left‐to‐right symmetry in the reaction force peaks of contralateral limbs of one horse exceeded 90 per cent. The time in the stance phase at which the peaks occur were even more symmetrically distributed. A characteristic force‐force diagram was constructed by plotting the longitudinal horizontal and the vertical ground reaction forces against each other; in this way the symmetry of loading of contralateral fore‐ and hindlimbs could be interpreted easily. Force plate tracings were obtained from eight horses (Group B) in three succesive years. The similarity of the tracings from a sound, well‐trained horse over that period was better than the differences between horses of the same breed.},

Ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected from 20 clinically sound Dutch Warmblood horses. The data from at least 5 stance phases of each limb were averaged after standardisation to the animal's body mass and to the stance phase duration and resulted in ‘representative’ GRF data. The symmetry in the vertical GRF peak amplitudes, impulses and the stance phase duration comparing left and right limbs exceeded 97\%. By averaging the ‘representative’ GRF of the 20 horses a ‘standard’ GRF pattern of the Dutch Warmblood horse at the trot was constructed. The GRF patterns at the trot, compared with those at the walk, showed only one vertical force peak in forelimbs and hindlimbs (11.59 N/kg and 10.21 N/kg, respectively). The retardatory and propulsory forces were distributed over the forelimbs and hindlimbs in such a way that the forelimbs contributed more to retardation (peak forces 1.13 and 0.79 N/kg), and the hindlimbs more to propulsion (−0.84 and −1.17 N/kg, respectively).},

  abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2-54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6-31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9\%, 8.9\%, and 20.9\% of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2\%, 16.4\%, and 18.5\%, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

  abstract = {A popular hypothesis for human running is that gait mechanics and muscular activity are optimized in order to minimize the cost of transport (CoT). Humans running at any particular speed appear to naturally select a stride length that maintains a low CoT when compared with other possible stride lengths. However, it is unknown if the nervous system prioritizes the CoT itself for minimization, or if some other quantity is minimized and a low CoT is a consequential effect. To address this question, we generated predictive computer simulations of running using an anatomically inspired musculoskeletal model and compared the results with data collected from human runners. Three simulations were generated by minimizing the CoT, the total muscle activation or the total muscle stress, respectively. While all the simulations qualitatively resembled real human running, minimizing activation predicted the most realistic joint angles and timing of muscular activity. While minimizing the CoT naturally predicted the lowest CoT, minimizing activation predicted a more realistic CoT in comparison with the experimental mean. The results suggest a potential control strategy centred on muscle activation for economical running.},

  abstract = {Background                                In transtibial limb loss, computer simulations suggest that the maintenance of muscle strength between pre- and post-limb loss can maintain the pre-limb loss metabolic cost. These results are consistent with comparable costs found experimentally in select cases of high functioning military service members with transtibial limb loss. It is unlikely that similar results would be found with transfemoral limb loss, although the theoretical limits are not known. Here we performed optimal control simulations of walking with and without an above-knee prosthesis to determine if transfemoral limb loss                 per se                 increases the metabolic cost of walking.                                                        Methods                                OpenSim Moco was used to generate optimal control simulations of walking in 15 virtual “subjects” that minimized the weighted sum of (i) deviations from average able-bodied gait mechanics and (ii) the gross metabolic cost of walking, pre-limb loss in models with two intact biological limbs, and post-limb loss with one of the limbs replaced by a prosthetic knee and foot. No other changes were made to the model. Metabolic cost was compared between pre- and post-limb loss simulations in paired                 t                 -tests.                                                        Results                                Metabolic cost post-limb loss increased by 0.7–9.3\% (                 p                 {$<$} 0.01) depending on whether cost was scaled by total body mass or biological body mass and on whether the prosthetic knee was passive or non-passive.                                                        Conclusions                                Given that the post-limb loss model had numerous features that predisposed it to low metabolic cost, these results suggest transfemoral limb loss                 per se                 increases the metabolic cost of walking. However, the large differences above able-bodied peers of ∼20–45\% in most gait analysis experiments may be avoidable, even when minimizing deviations from able-bodied gait mechanics.

  abstract = {Loss of a lower limb below the knee,               i.e.               , transtibial limb loss, and subsequently walking with a prosthesis, is generally thought to increase the metabolic cost of walking               vs               . able-bodied controls. However, high-functioning individuals with limb loss such as military service members often walk with the same metabolic cost as controls. Here we used a 3-D computer model and optimal control simulation approach to test the hypothesis that transtibial limb loss in and of itself causes an increase in metabolic cost of walking. We first generated               N               ~=~36 simulations of walking at 1.45 m/s using a “pre-limb loss” model, with two intact biological legs, that minimized deviations from able-bodied experimental walking mechanics with minimum muscular effort. We then repeated these simulations using a “post-limb loss” model, with the right leg’s ankle muscles and joints replaced with a simple model of a passive transtibial prosthesis. No other changes were made to the post-limb loss model’s remaining muscles or musculoskeletal parameters compared to the pre-limb loss case. Post-limb loss, the gait deviations on average increased by only 0.17 standard deviations from the experimental means, and metabolic cost did not increase (3.58~±~0.10 J/m/kg pre-limb loss vs. 3.59~±~0.12 J/m/kg post-limb loss,               p               ~=~0.65). The results suggest that transtibial limb loss does not directly lead to an increase in metabolic cost, even when deviations from able-bodied gait mechanics are minimized. High metabolic costs observed in individuals with transtibial limb loss may be due to secondary changes in strength or general fitness after limb loss, modifiable prosthesis issues, or to prioritization of factors that affect locomotor control other than gait deviations and muscular effort.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Three-dimensional motion capture and metabolic assessment were performed on four standardbred horses while walking, trotting and galloping on a motorized treadmill at different speeds. The mechanical work was partitioned into the internal work (WINT), due to the speed changes of body segments with respect to the body centre of mass, and the external work (WEXT), due to the position and speed changes of the body centre of mass with respect to the environment. The estimated total mechanical work (WTOT=WINT+WEXT) increased with speed, while metabolic work (C) remained rather constant. As a consequence, the ‘apparent efficiency’ (effAPP=WTOT/C) increased from 10 \% (walking) to over 100 \% (galloping), setting the highest value to date for terrestrial locomotion. The contribution of elastic structures in the horse’s limbs was evaluated by calculating the elastic energy stored and released during a single bounce (WEL,BOUNCE), which was approximately 1.23 J kg−1 for trotting and up to 6 J kg−1 for galloping. When taking into account the elastic energy stored by the spine bending and released as WINT, as suggested in the literature for galloping, WEL,BOUNCE was reduced by 0.88 J kg−1. Indirect evidence indicates that force, in addition to mechanical work, is also a determinant of the metabolic energy expenditure in horse locomotion.},

Yet the potential impacts that over a century of predator exclusion might have had on the population dynamics and developmental biology of prey populations has not been assessed. We here combine demographic data and both linear and geometric morphometrics to assess differences in populations among 166 red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus)—a primary prey species of the dingo—from two isolated populations on either side of the fence. We also quantified the differences in aboveground vegetation biomass for the last 10 years on either side of the fence. We found that the age structure and growth patterns, but not cranial shape, differed between the two kangaroo populations. In the population living with a higher density of dingoes, there were relatively fewer females and juveniles. These individuals were larger for a given age, despite what seems to be lower vegetation biomass. However, how much of this biomass represented kangaroo forage is uncertain and requires further on-site assessments. We also identified unexpected differences in the ontogenetic trajectories in relative pes length between the sexes for the whole sample, possibly associated with male competition or differential weight-bearing mechanics. We discuss potential mechanisms behind our findings and suggest that the impacts of contrasting predation pressures across the fence, for red kangaroos and other species, merit further investigation.},

  abstract = {Sensorimotor control is greatly affected by two factors—the time it takes for an animal to sense and respond to stimuli (responsiveness), and the ability of an animal to distinguish between sensory stimuli and generate graded muscle forces (resolution). Here, we demonstrate that anatomical limitations force a necessary trade-off between responsiveness and resolution with increases in animal size. To determine whether responsiveness is prioritized over resolution, or resolution over responsiveness, we studied how size influences the physiological mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control. Using both new electrophysiological experiments and existing data, we determined the maximum axonal conduction velocity (CV) in animals ranging in size from shrews to elephants. Over the 100-fold increase in leg length, CV was nearly constant, increasing proportionally with mass to the 0.04 power. As a consequence, larger animals are burdened with relatively long physiological delays, which may have broad implications for their behaviour, ecology and evolution, including constraining agility and requiring prediction to help control movements.},

  abstract = {For better understanding of the links between limb morphology and the metabolic cost of locomotion, we have characterized the relationships between limb length and shape and other functionally important variables in the straightened forelimbs and hindlimbs of a sample of 12 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Intra-animal comparisons show that forelimbs and hindlimbs are very similar (not significantly different) in natural pendular period (NPP), center-of-mass, and radius of gyration, even though they differ distinctly in mass, length, moment-of-inertia, and other limb proportions. The conservation of limb NPP, despite pronounced dissimilarity in other limb characteristics, appears to be the result of systematic differences in shape, forelimbs tending to be cylindrical and hindlimbs conical. Estimating limb NPP for other species from data in the literature on segment inertia and total limb length, we present evidence that the similarity between forelimbs and hindlimbs in NPP is generally true for mammals across a large size range. Limbs swinging with or near their natural pendular periods will maximize within-limb pendular exchange of potential and kinetic energy. As all four limbs of moderate- and large-size animals swing with the same period during walking, maximal advantage can be derived from the pendular exchange of energy only if forelimbs and hindlimbs are very similar in NPP. We hypothesize that an important constraint in the evolution of limb length and shape is the locomotor economy derived from forelimbs and hindlimbs of similar natural pendular period.},

  abstract = {The sarcomeres of striated muscle are among the most elaborate and dynamic eukaryotic cellular protein machinery, and the mechanisms by which these semicrystalline filament networks are initially patterned and assembled remain contentious. In addition to the acto-myosin filaments that provide motor function, the sarcomere contains titin filaments, comprised of individual molecules of the giant Ig- and fibronectin domain-rich protein titin. Titin is the largest known protein, containing many structurally distinct domains with a variety of proposed functions, including sarcomere stabilization, the prevention of over-stretching, and returning to resting length after contraction. One molecule of titin, which binds to both the Z-disk and the M-line, spans a half-sarcomere, and is proposed to serve as a "molecular ruler" that dictates the spacing of sarcomeres. The semirigid rod-like A-band region of titin has also been proposed to act as a scaffold for thick filament formation during muscle development, but despite decades of research, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Recent studies in zebrafish have brought into question the necessity for the A-band region of titin during the early stages of sarcomere patterning. In this review, we give an overview of the many different roles of titin in the development and function of striated muscle, and address the validity of the "molecular ruler" model of myofibrillogenesis in light of the current literature.},

  abstract = {Summary                            The structure of the limbs of elephants is unusual among mammals. In African elephants (               Loxodonta africana               , Blumenbach 1797), the front limbs serve to support the greatest part of the body mass of the largest land animal. In this study, we present new and detailed anatomical data regarding muscular and specific fascial structures of the lower front limb which were examined by means of standard anatomical and histological techniques. The muscles and tendons of the forearm (antebrachium) and hand (manus) are tightly surrounded by thick, highly elastic fascial layers which fuse with the lacertus (lac.) fibrosus and the so‐called ligamentum (lig.) humeroulnare. A well‐developed musculus (m.) brachioradialis occupies the proximolateral aspect of the forearm and its tendon inserts together with the lac. fibrosus on the os carpi intermedium. The lac. fibrosus, the lig. humeroulnare and the m. flexor carpi radialis reveal a large proportion of elastic fibres. These three structures may play an important role in storing strain energy thus promoting energy‐saving locomotion. On the palmar aspect of the carpus, metacarpus and digits, short flexor, abductor, adductor, lumbricales and interossei muscles are present, whereas supinator muscles are absent in all specimens. The short muscles of the hand together with specific dorsal tendons enable precise movements of specific toes.},

However, it is unclear whether the components of the muscle-tendon unit are affected by a static stretch training program. This study investigated the effect of a four-week static stretch training program on the viscoelastic properties of the muscle-tendon unit and muscle. The subjects comprised 18 male participants (mean age 21.4 ± 1.7 years). The range of motion (ROM), passive torque, myotendinous junction (MTJ) displacement and, muscle fascicle length of the gastrocnemius muscle were assessed using both ultrasonography and a dynamometer while the ankle was passively dorsiflexed. After the initial test, the participants were assigned either to a group that stretched for 4 weeks (N = 9) or to a control group (N = 9). The tests were repeated after the static stretch training program. The ROM and MTJ displacement significantly increased, and the passive torque at 30° significantly decreased, in the stretching group after the study period. However, there was no significant increase in muscle fascicle length. These results suggest that a 4-week static stretch training program changes the flexibility of the overall MTU without causing concomitant changes in muscle fascicle length.},

  abstract = {The relationship between muscle structure and function has been a matter of investigation since the Renaissance period. Extensive use of anatomical dissections and the introduction of the scientific method enabled early scholars to lay the foundations of muscle physiology and biomechanics. Progression of knowledge in these disciplines led to the current understanding that muscle architecture, together with muscle fibre contractile properties, has a major influence on muscle mechanical properties. Recently, advances in laser diffraction, optical microendoscopy and ultrasonography have enabled in vivo investigations into the behaviour of human muscle fascicles and sarcomeres with varying joint angle and muscle contraction intensity. With these technologies it has become possible to identify the length region over which fascicles and sarcomeres develop maximum isometric force in vivo as well as the operating ranges of fascicles and sarcomeres during real-life activities such as walking. Also, greater insights into the remodelling of muscle architecture in response to overloading and unloading, and in ageing, have been obtained by the use of ultrasonography; these have led to the identification of clinical biomarkers of disuse atrophy and sarcopenia. Recent evidence also shows that the pattern of muscle hypertrophy in response to chronic loading is contraction-mode dependent (eccentric versus concentric), as similar gains in muscle mass, but through differing addition of sarcomeres in series and in parallel (as indirectly inferred from changes in fascicle length and pennation angle), have been found. These innovative observations prompted a new set of investigations into the molecular mechanisms regulating this contraction-specific muscle growth.},

Based on the idea of bionics, this paper intends to obtain a kind of robotic leg structure with a similar buffering capacity to that of the ostrich. For this purpose, the structural characteristics of a seven-link parallel mechanism are analyzed firstly, having some specific features similar to ostrich legs, such as the center of mass (COM) located at the root of the leg, a large folding/unfolding ratio, and so on. Then, the kinematic model of the bionic leg is established, and the energy storage of the flexible parts of the leg is investigated. Finally, an impact experiment of the structure onto the ground is carried out to verify the accuracy of the established kinematic model. This paper systematically reveals the nonlinear law of the elasticity of an ostrich-like leg and provides the buffering performance characteristics of the leg in the process of hitting the ground, based on its elastic properties by the kinematic model and the experiment.},

  abstract = {Optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal models can be used to reconstruct motions measured with optical motion capture to estimate joint and muscle kinematics and kinetics. These simulations are mutually and dynamically consistent, in contrast to traditional inverse methods. Commonly, optimal control simulations are generated by tracking generalized coordinates in combination with ground reaction forces. The generalized coordinates are estimated from marker positions using, for example, inverse kinematics. Hence, inaccuracies in the estimated coordinates are tracked in the simulation. We developed an approach to reconstruct arbitrary motions, such as change of direction motions, using optimal control simulations of 3D full-body musculoskeletal models by directly tracking marker and ground reaction force data. For evaluation, we recorded three trials each of straight running, curved running, and a v-cut for 10 participants. We reconstructed the recordings with marker tracking simulations, coordinate tracking simulations, and inverse kinematics and dynamics. First, we analyzed the convergence of the simulations and found that the wall time increased three to four times when using marker tracking compared to coordinate tracking. Then, we compared the marker trajectories, ground reaction forces, pelvis translations, joint angles, and joint moments between the three reconstruction methods. Root mean squared deviations between measured and estimated marker positions were smallest for inverse kinematics (               e.g               ., 7.6 ± 5.1 mm for v-cut). However, measurement noise and soft tissue artifacts are likely also tracked in inverse kinematics, meaning that this approach does not reflect a gold standard. Marker tracking simulations resulted in slightly higher root mean squared marker deviations (               e.g               ., 9.5 ± 6.2 mm for v-cut) than inverse kinematics. In contrast, coordinate tracking resulted in deviations that were nearly twice as high (               e.g               ., 16.8 ± 10.5 mm for v-cut). Joint angles from coordinate tracking followed the estimated joint angles from inverse kinematics more closely than marker tracking (               e.g               ., root mean squared deviation of 1.4 ± 1.8 deg               vs               . 3.5 ± 4.0 deg for v-cut). However, we did not have a gold standard measurement of the joint angles, so it is unknown if this larger deviation means the solution is less accurate. In conclusion, we showed that optimal control simulations of change of direction running motions can be created by tracking marker and ground reaction force data. Marker tracking considerably improved marker accuracy compared to coordinate tracking. Therefore, we recommend reconstructing movements by directly tracking marker data in the optimal control simulation when precise marker tracking is required.},

The ptarmigan used three different gaits: a walking gait at slow speeds (less than or equal to 0.75 m s               −1               ), grounded running at intermediate speeds (0.75 m s               −1               {$<$}               U               {$<$} 1.67 m s               −1               ) and aerial running at high speeds (greater than or equal to 1.67 m s               −1               ). Changes of gait were associated with reductions in the gross cost of transport (COT; J kg               −1               m               −1               ), providing the first evidence for energy savings with gait change in a small crouched-postured vertebrate. In addition, for the first time (excluding humans) a decrease in absolute metabolic energy expenditure (rate of O               2               consumption) in aerial running when compared with grounded running was identified. The COT versus               U               curve varies between species and the COT was cheaper during aerial running than grounded running, posing the question of why grounded running should be used at all. Existing explanations (e.g. stability during running over rocky terrain) amount to               just so               stories with no current evidence to support them. It may be that grounded running is just an artefact of treadmill studies. Research investigating the speeds used by animals in the field is sorely needed.},

This species has a high incidence of spontaneous fatigue failure of bone (bucked shins) during its early training. In vivo strain gauge studies of the third metacarpal bone o four young racehorses running at racing speeds showed high principal compressive strains [−4,841 ± 572 (SD) microstrain] while two older horses had lower principal compressive strains (−3,317 microstrain measured at racing speed, −3,250 microstrain extrapolated from a slower speed run). Previously reported intertial property measurements of the third metacarpal bone were related to the diffeence in bone strains seen in young and older horses. The high strains on the surface of the third metacarpal bone associated with young horses in training may lead to high strain, low cycle fatigue. The changing shape of the third metacarpal bone during maturation may be consistent with the lower strains recorded during high speed exercise in theo lder animals. This phenomenon may allow for the accumulation of additional strain cycles in older animals beore failure occurs.},

Here, we use kinematics and center of mass (CoM) mechanical energy patterns to investigate gait transitions of lapwings—migratory birds that forage on the ground, and therefore may need a trade‐off between the functional demands of terrestrial locomotion and long distance flights. The animals ran on a treadmill while high‐speed X‐ray videos were recorded within the sustainable speed range. Instantaneous CoM mechanics were computed from integrating kinematics and body segment properties. Lapwings exhibit similar locomotor characteristics to specialized walking/running birds, but have less distinct gaits. At slow speeds no clear separation between vaulting (i.e., walking) and bouncing (i.e., running) energy patterns exists. Mechanical energy recovery of non‐bouncing gaits correlates poorly with speed and suggests inefficient use of the inverted pendulum mechanism. Speed ranges of gaits overlap considerably, especially those of grounded running, a gait with CoM mechanics indicative of running but without an aerial phase, and aerial phase running, with no preferential gait at most speeds. Compliant limb morphology and grounded running in birds can be regarded as an evolutionary constraint, but lapwings effectively make use of advantages offered by this gait for a great fraction of their speed range. Thus, effective usage of grounded running during terrestrial locomotion is suggested generally to be a part of striding avian bipedalism—even in species not specialized in walking/running locomotion.

  abstract = {To better understand the effects of pubertal maturation on the contractile properties of skeletal muscle               in vivo               , the present study investigated whether there are any differences in the specific tension of the quadriceps muscle in 20 adults and 20 prepubertal children of both sexes. Specific tension was calculated as the ratio between the quadriceps tendon force and the sum of the physiological cross‐sectional area (PCSA) multiplied by the cosine of the angle of pennation of each head within the quadriceps muscle. The maximal quadriceps tendon force was calculated from the knee extension maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) by accounting for EMG‐based estimates of antagonist co‐activation, incomplete quadriceps activation using the interpolation twitch technique and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐based measurements of the patellar tendon moment arm. The PCSA was calculated as the muscle volume, measured from MRI scans, divided by optimal fascicle length, measured from ultrasound images during MVC at the estimated angle of peak quadriceps muscle force. It was found that the quadriceps tendon force and PCSA of men (11.4 kN, 214 cm               2               ) were significantly greater than those of the women (8.7 kN, 152 cm               2               ;               P               {$<$} 0.01). Both adult groups had greater values than the children (               P               {$<$} 0.01) but there were no differences between boys (5.2 kN, 99 cm               2               ) and girls (6.1 kN, 102 cm               2               ). Agonist activation was greater in men and women than in girls (               P               {$<$} 0.05), and antagonist activation was greater in men than in boys (               P               {$<$} 0.05). Moment arm length was greater in men than in boys or girls and greater in women than in boys (               P               {$<$} 0.05). The angle of pennation did not differ between the groups in any of the quadriceps heads. The specific tension was similar (               P               {$>$} 0.05) between groups: men, 55 ± 11 N cm               −2               ; women, 57.3 ± 13 N cm               −2               ; boys, 54 ± 14 N cm               −2               ; and girls, 59.8 ± 15 N cm               −2               . These findings indicate that the increased muscle strength with maturation is not due to an increase in the specific tension of muscle; instead, it can be attributed to increases in muscle size, moment arm length and voluntary activation level.},

By double-staining the growth tips of transfected myotubes expressing (a) MYC-tagged s-alpha-actinins (MYC/s-alpha-actinins) or (b) green fluorescent protein-tagged titin cap (GFP/T-cap) with antibodies against MYC and I-Z-I band proteins, we found that the de novo assembly of I-Z-I bodies and their maturation into I-Z-I bands involved relatively concurrent, cooperative binding and reconfiguration of, at a minimum, 5 integral Z-band molecules. These included s-alpha-actinin, nebulin, titin, T-cap and alpha-actin. Resolution of the approximately 1.0 microm polarized alpha-actin/nebulin/tropomyosin/troponin thin filament complexes occurred subsequent to the maturation of Z-bands into a dense tetragonal configuration. Of particular interest is finding that mutant MYC/s-alpha-actinin peptides (a) lacking spectrin-like repeats 1-4, or consisting of spectrin-like repeats 1-4 only, as well as (b) mutants/fragments lacking titin or alpha-actin binding sites, were promptly and exclusively incorporated into de novo assembling I-Z-I bodies and definitive I-Z-I bands as was exogenous full length MYC/s-alpha-actinin or GFP/T-cap.},

Various lubricants have been used to lubricate the hip joints including bovine and human synovial fluid, synovial fluid which has been digested with hyaluronidase or trypsin, silicone fluids of different viscosities, as well as synovial fluid and Ringer's solution which have had their viscosities increased by the addition of hyaluronic acid.

  abstract = {Previous models have theorized that, during phonation, skewing of the glottal waveform (which is correlated with acoustic intensity) occurred because of inertance of the vocal tract. Later, we reported that skewing of the flow rate waveform can occur without the presence of a vocal tract in an excised canine larynx. We hypothesized that in the absence of a vocal tract, the skewing formed when dynamic pressures acted on the glottal wall during the closing phase; such pressures were greatly affected by formation of intraglottal vortices. In this study, we aim to identify how changes in false vocal folds constriction can affect the acoustics and intraglottal flow dynamics. The intraglottal flow measurements were made using particle image velocimetry in an excised canine larynx where a vocal tract model was placed above the larynx and the constriction between the false vocal folds was varied. Our results show that for similar values of subglottal pressures, the skewing of the glottal waveform, strength of the intraglottal vortices, and acoustic energy increased as the constriction between the false vocal folds was increased. These preliminary findings suggest that acoustic intensity during phonation can be increased by the addition of a vocal tract with false fold constriction.},

  abstract = {The Morrison Formation of the Late Jurassic Period is characterized by its diverse assemblage of sauropods, several species of which reached the size of modern cetaceans. While much scientific attention has concerned their biology in life, researchers have yet to examine how their massive carcasses may have influenced the evolution of other dinosaurs in their communities, such as theropods. Theropod consumers local to this faunal system are typically described as powerful apex predators at the top of local food webs, but instead, may have been shaped by competition for carrion resources generated as a byproduct of their giant sauropod neighbors. To test this hypothesis, we wrote a series of agent-based simulations (ABS). Specifically, we simulated allosaurid consumer behavior versus spatially distributed sauropod carcass resources such as could be expected in eco­ systems like that represented in the Morrison Formation. We incorporated conditions to test how competition among consumers, seasonality, and predation success influenced carnosaur survival both with and without carrion-abundant systems. Trials of the ABS resulted in a strong selective advantage for allosaurs as obligate scavengers because of the high metabolic and survival costs associated with predation of large vertebrates. Allosaurs with increased predatory success over peers failed to succeed competitively unless the probability of scavenging opportunities fell below a certain threshold and a significant proportion of herbivores were available as prey targets, which might not have been the case in sauropod-dominated systems. Our results may explain why carnosaurs like Allosaurus did not evolve powerful bite forces, binocular vision, or advanced cursorial ad­ aptations. Given the enormous supply of sauropod carrion, they were under no resource-based selective pressure to overpower prey and may have evolved as terrestrial vulture analogues. This also may explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyran­ nosaurs. Tyrannosaurs may have been forced to meet their energy budgets by hunting, because non-sauropod carrion production was too low to support them passively.},

  abstract = {Horse racing is a multi-billion-dollar industry that has raised welfare concerns due to injured and euthanized animals. Whilst the cause of musculoskeletal injuries that lead to horse morbidity and mortality is multifactorial, pre-existing pathologies, increased speeds and substrate of the racecourse are likely contributors to foot disease. Horse hooves have the ability to naturally deform during locomotion and dissipate locomotor stresses, yet farriery approaches are utilised to increase performance and protect hooves from wear. Previous studies have assessed the effect of different shoe designs on locomotor performance; however, no biomechanical study has hitherto measured the effect of horseshoes on the stresses of the foot skeleton               in vivo               . This preliminary study introduces a novel methodology combining three-dimensional data from biplanar radiography with inverse dynamics methods and finite element analysis (FEA) to evaluate the effect of a stainless steel shoe on the function of a Thoroughbred horse’s forefoot during walking. Our preliminary results suggest that the stainless steel shoe shifts craniocaudal, mediolateral and vertical GRFs at mid-stance. We document a similar pattern of flexion-extension in the PIP (pastern) and DIP (coffin) joints between the unshod and shod conditions, with slight variation in rotation angles throughout the stance phase. For both conditions, the PIP and DIP joints begin in a flexed posture and extend over the entire stance phase. At mid-stance, small differences in joint angle are observed in the PIP joint, with the shod condition being more extended than the unshod horse, whereas the DIP joint is extended more in the unshod than the shod condition. We also document that the DIP joint extends more than the PIP after mid-stance and until the end of the stance in both conditions. Our FEA analysis, conducted solely on the bones, shows increased von Mises and Maximum principal stresses on the forefoot phalanges in the shod condition at mid-stance, consistent with the tentative conclusion that a steel shoe might increase mechanical loading. However, because of our limited sample size none of these apparent differences have been tested for statistical significance. Our preliminary study illustrates how the shoe may influence the dynamics and mechanics of a Thoroughbred horse’s forefoot during slow walking, but more research is needed to quantify the effect of the shoe on the equine forefoot during the whole stance phase, at faster speeds/gaits and with more individuals as well as with a similar focus on the hind feet. We anticipate that our preliminary analysis using advanced methodological approaches will pave the way for new directions in research on the form/function relationship of the equine foot, with the ultimate goal to minimise foot injuries and improve animal health and welfare.},

  abstract = {The emu is a giant flightless bird, capable of sustained high-speed running. Anatomical, histochemical and biochemical properties of the lower leg muscles used to power running were investigated. The gastrocnemius is the largest muscle in the emu leg. It has a short inelastic tendon and contains only fast fibres. It is the major power-producing muscle of the lower leg, with a greater capacity than the digital flexor muscles for bursts of high work output. In marked contrast, the digital flexors have long elastic tendons and contain both fast and slow muscle fibres. It is proposed that these muscles, rather than the gastrocnemius, are responsible for maintaining posture and that they facilitate elastic energy storage and retrieval in their tendons during running. In comparison with equivalent muscles of flying and diving birds, emu lower leg muscles display features consistent with greater power output during both short burst and endurance running. The emu muscles are more massive relative to body size, and the gastrocnemii of other birds invariably contain slow fibres This study illustrates some of the similarities as well as differences between muscles used during flying and running. Capacities for sustained high-energy work appear to be similar in flying birds and running emus as judged from (1) the muscle masses used during locomotion when expressed as a proportion of total body mass and (2) muscle fibre type compositions and their potential for fuel catabolism. The lower creatine kinase activity in emu leg muscles could be attributed to higher energy demands during the initial stages of lift-off for flight.},

  abstract = {Intensive artificial selection has led to the production of the modern broiler chicken, which over the last few decades has undergone a dramatic increase in growth rate and noticeable changes in body conformation. Unfortunately, this has been associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities which have altered the walking ability of these birds, raising obvious welfare concerns, as well as causing economic losses. Here we present a comparative study of ancestral and derived muscle anatomy in chickens to begin to tease apart how evolutionary alterations of muscle form in chickens have influenced their locomotor function and perhaps contributed to lameness. We measured the muscle architectural properties of the right pelvic limb in 50 birds, including the Giant Junglefowl, a commercial strain broiler and four pureline commercial broiler breeder lines (from which the broiler populations are derived) to identify which features of the broiler’s architectural design have diverged the most from the ancestral condition. We report a decline in pelvic limb muscle mass in the commercial line birds that may compromise their locomotor abilities because they carry a larger body mass. This greater demand on the pelvic limb muscles has mostly led to changes in support at the hip joint, revealing significantly larger abductors and additionally much larger medial rotators in the broiler population. Differences were seen within the commercial line bird populations, which are likely attributed to different selection pressures and may reflect differences in the walking ability of these birds. In addition, Junglefowl seem to have both greater force-generating capabilities and longer, presumably faster contracting muscles, indicative of superior musculoskeletal ⁄ locomotor function. We have provided baseline data for generating hypotheses to investigate in greater depth the specific biomechanical constraints that compromise the modern broiler’s walking ability and propose that these factors should be considered in the selection for musculoskeletal health in the chickens of the future. Our new anatomical data for a wide range of domestic and wild-type chickens is useful in a comparative context and for deeper functional analysis including computer modelling ⁄ simulation of limb mechanics.},

When compared with published data on thoracic limb muscles, proximal pelvic limb muscles were larger in volume and had shorter fascicles. Distal limb muscle architecture was similar in thoracic and pelvic limbs with the exception of flexor digitorum lateralis (lateral head of the deep digital flexor), the architecture of which was similar to that of the pelvic and thoracic limb superficial digital flexors, suggesting a functional similarity.},

Economical force generation is achieved by short‐fibred pennate muscle while the maximum power output of a muscle is architecture independent. In this study we tested the hypothesis that there is an anatomical and structural separation between the force‐generating anti‐gravity muscles and the propulsive (limb/trunk moving) muscles of the equine forelimb. Muscle mass and fascicle length measurements were made on the thoracic limb extrinsic muscles of six fresh horse cadavers. Physiological cross‐sectional area and maximum isometric force were then estimated. Maximum power was estimated from muscle volume and published contraction velocity data. The majority of extrinsic forelimb muscles were large with long fascicles arranged in parallel to the long axis of the muscle. Muscles arranged in this way are optimised for doing work. The architecture of serratus ventralis thoracis (SVT) was unique. It had short (48~±~17~mm) fascicles, arranged at about 45° to the long axis of the muscle, which would suggest a force‐generating, anti‐gravity role. The muscle belly of SVT was sandwiched between two broad, thick sheets of aponeurosis. Hence, SVT could make a significant contribution to the overall elastic properties of the thoracic limb.},

  abstract = {Background A chronic regimen of flexibility training can increase range of motion, with the increase mechanisms believed to be a change in the muscle material properties or in the neural components associated with this type of training. Methods This study followed chronic structural adaptations of lateral gastrocnemius muscle of rats submitted to stretching training (3 times a week during 8 weeks), based on muscle architecture measurements including pennation angle, muscle thickness and tendon length obtained from ultrasound biomicroscopic images, in vivo. Fiber length and sarcomere number per 100 ??m were determined in 3 fibers of each muscle (ex vivo and in vitro, respectively), using conventional optical microscopy. Findings Stretching training resulted in a significant pennation angle reduction of the stretched leg after 12 sessions (25\%, P = 0.002 to 0.024). Muscle thickness and tendon length presented no significant changes. Fiber length presented a significant increase for the stretched leg (8.5\%, P = 0.00006), with the simultaneous increase in sarcomere length (5\%, P = 0.041) since the stretched muscles presented less sarcomeres per 100 ??m. Interpretation A stretching protocol with characteristics similar to those applied in humans was sufficient to modify muscle architecture of rats with absence of a sarcomerogenesis process. The results indicate that structural adaptations take place in skeletal muscle tissue submitted to moderate-intensity stretching training. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The heads of two adult giraffes and one fetus were used in this study. The lips were well developed, the upper one was predominant and dorsally flattened near the nostrils. The tongue had a lift or lingual torus and rostrally to it a groove-shaped depression or fossa linguae. There was no adipose body of cheek (Corpus adiposum buccae). The hard palate in the giraffe had 18 Rugae palatinae. The final roughness reaches the caudal border of the premolar 3. Caudal ridges had no papillae. The parotid gland was small and consisted of two lobes, one rostral and one caudal to be separated dorsally to accommodate the parotid lymph node. The parotid duct followed the same way as in the cow, ended in front of the upper premolar tooth 2 in the parotid papilla, (not evident at mucosal surface). Mandibular gland was divided into two lobes, the rostral one placed in the intermandibular space and the caudal hidden by the parotid gland. Giraffes have the monostomatic and polistomatic sublingual glands. The monostomatic sublingual gland was located rostrally and joined to the monostomatic of the other side in the very narrow rostral intermandibular space. The polistomatic sublingual gland was caudally located and reached the level of the third molar and at a deeper level than the monostomatic. The studied giraffes had dorsal, ventral and intermediate bucal salivary glands. Leaving aside the differences caused by different dimensions, the mouth of the giraffe had in general a similar anatomical arrangement to the cow.},

  abstract = {In the South American abelisaurids Carnotaurus sastrei, Aucasaurus garridoi, and, to a lesser extent Skorpiovenator bustingorryi, the anterior caudal ribs project at a high dorsolateral inclination and have interlocking lateral tips. This unique morphology facilitated the expansion of the caudal hypaxial musculature at the expense of the epaxial musculature. Distinct ridges on the ventrolateral surfaces of the caudal ribs of Aucasaurus garridoi are interpreted as attachment scars from the intra caudofemoralis/ilio-ischiocaudalis septa, and confirm that the M. caudofemoralis of advanced South American abelisaurids originated from a portion of the caudal ribs. Digital muscle models indicate that, relative to its overall body size, Carnotaurus sastrei had a substantially larger M. caudofemoralis than any other theropod yet studied. In most non-avian theropods, as in many extant sauropsids, the M. caudofemoralis served as the primary femoral retractor muscle during the locomotive power stroke. This large investment in the M. caudofemoralis suggests that Carnotaurus sastrei had the potential for great cursorial abilities, particularly short-burst sprinting. However, the tightly interlocking morphology of the anterior caudal vertebrae implies a reduced ability to make tight turns. Examination of these vertebral traits in evolutionary context reveals a progressive sequence of increasing caudofemoral mass and tail rigidity among the Abelisauridae of South America.},

  abstract = {Unlike extant birds and mammals, most non-avian theropods had large muscular tails, with muscle arrangements similar to those of modern reptiles. Examination of ornithomimid and tyrannosaurid tails revealed sequential diagonal scarring on the lateral faces of four or more hemal spines that consistently correlates with the zone of the tail just anterior to the disappearance of the vertebral transverse processes. This sequential scarring is interpreted as the tapering boundary between the insertions of the M. caudofemoralis and the M. ilioischiocaudalis. Digital muscle reconstructions based on measurements of fossil specimens and dissections of modern reptiles showed that the M. caudofemoralis of many non-avian theropods was exceptionally large. These high caudofemoral mass estimates are consistent with the elevation of the transverse processes of the caudal vertebra above the centrum, which creates an enlarged hypaxial region. Dorsally elevated transverse processes are characteristic of even primitive theropods and suggest that a large M. caudofemoralis is a basal characteristic of the group. In the genus Tyrannosaurus, the mass of the M. caudofemoralis was further increased by dorsoventrally lengthening the hemal arches. The expanded M. caudofemoralis of Tyrannosaurus may have evolved as compensation for the animal's immense size. Because the M. caudofemoralis is the primary hind limb retractor, large M. caudofemoralis masses and the resulting contractile force and torque estimates presented here indicate a sizable investment in locomotive muscle among theropods with a range of body sizes and give new evidence in favor of greater athleticism, in terms of overall cursoriality, balance, and turning agility.},

It is a cursorial, flightless species with long powerful legs and reduced forelimbs. The goal of this study was to explore how hindlimb muscles scale with body mass during postnatal growth and to analyze whether the specialized locomotion of this species affects the growth of muscle masses. The mass of 19 muscles and body mass were weighed in 21 specimens ranging from 1‐month‐old individuals to adults. Seventeen muscles scaled with positive allometry with respect to body mass, whereas two muscles scaled isometrically               .               The predominance of positive allometric growth in hindlimb muscles results in a limb with massive and powerful muscles specialized to support a large body mass and to attain relatively high running speeds. Analysis of muscle mass scaling is a simple and useful way to compare possible differences between locomotor styles, and it is valuable in studies that reconstruct the paleobiology of extinct taxa.},

  abstract = {Many quadrupedal mammals transition from a four-beat walk to a twobeat run (e.g. trot), but some transition to a four-beat run (e.g. amble). Recent analysis shows that a two-beat run minimizes work only for animals with a small pitch moment of inertia (MOI), though empirical MOI were not reported. It was also unclear whether MOI affects gait energetics at slow speeds. Here, I show that a particular normalization of the pitch moment of inertia (the Murphy number) has opposite effects on walking and running energetics. During walking, simultaneous forelimb and hindlimb contacts dampen pitching energy, favouring a four-beat gait that can distribute expensive transfer of support. However, the required pitching of a four-beat walk becomes more expensive as Murphy number increases. Using trajectory optimization of a simple model, I show that both the walking and slow running strategies used by dogs, horses, giraffes and elephants can be explained by work optimization under their specific Murphy numbers. Rotational dynamics have been largely ignored in quadrupedal locomotion, but appear to be a central factor in gait selection.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             Movement is integral to animal life, and most animal movement is actuated by the same engine: striated muscle. Muscle input is typically mediated by skeletal elements, resulting in musculoskeletal systems that are geared: at any instant, the muscle force and velocity are related to the output force and velocity only via a proportionality constant G, the “mechanical advantage”. The functional analysis of such “simple machines” has traditionally centered around this instantaneous interpretation, such that a small vs large G is thought to reflect a fast vs forceful system, respectively. But evidence is mounting that a comprehensive analysis ought to also consider the mechanical energy output of a complete contraction. Here, we approach this task systematically, and deploy the theory of physiological similarity to study how gearing affects the flow of mechanical energy in a minimalist model of a musculoskeletal system. Gearing influences the flow of mechanical energy in two key ways: it can curtail muscle work output, because it determines the ratio between the characteristic muscle kinetic energy and work capacity; and it defines how each unit of muscle work is partitioned into different system energies, that is, into kinetic vs “parasitic” energy such as heat. As a consequence of both effects, delivering maximum work in minimum time and with maximum output speed generally requires a mechanical advantage of intermediate magnitude. This optimality condition can be expressed in terms of two dimensionless numbers that reflect the key geometric, physiological, and physical properties of the interrogated musculoskeletal system, and the environment in which the contraction takes place. Illustrative application to exemplar musculoskeletal systems predicts plausible mechanical advantages in disparate biomechanical scenarios, yields a speculative explanation for why gearing is typically used to attenuate the instantaneous force output (\$G\_\{\textbackslash text\{opt\}\} \textbackslash lt 1)\$, and predicts how G needs to vary systematically with animal size to optimize the delivery of mechanical energy, in superficial agreement with empirical observations. A many-to-one mapping from musculoskeletal geometry to mechanical performance is identified, such that differences in G alone do not provide a reliable indicator for specialization for force vs speed—neither instantaneously, nor in terms of mechanical energy output. The energy framework presented here can be used to estimate an optimal mechanical advantage across variable muscle physiology, anatomy, mechanical environment, and animal size, and so facilitates investigation of the extent to which selection has made efficient use of gearing as a degree of freedom in musculoskeletal “design.”},

The second objective was to determine whether computing strains solely in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the humerus in the mathematical model was inherently limited by comparing the strains measured along the longitudinal axis of the bone to the principal strain magnitudes and directions. The final objective was to determine whether the mathematical model formulated in Part I [Pollock et al., 2008, ASME J. Biomech. Eng., 130, p. 041006] is valid for determining the bone surface strains at the various locations on the humerus where experimentally measured longitudinal strains are comparable to principal strains. Triple rosette strain gauges were applied at four locations circumferentially on each of two cross sections of interest using a simplified in vitro laboratory preparation. The muscles included the biceps brachii muscle in addition to loaded shoulder muscles that were predicted active by the mathematical model. Strains from the middle grid of each rosette, aligned along the longitudinal axis of the humerus, were compared with calculated principal strain magnitudes and directions. The results indicated that calculating strains solely in the direction of the longitudinal axis is appropriate at six of eight locations. At the cranial and medial aspects of the middle of the diaphysis, the average minimum principal strain was not comparable to the average experimental longitudinal strain. Further analysis at the remaining six locations indicated that the mathematical model formulated in Part I predicts strains within ±2 standard deviations of experimental strains at four of these locations and predicts negligible strains at the remaining two locations, which is consistent with experimental strains. Experimentally determined longitudinal strains at the middle of the diaphysis of the humerus indicate that tensile strains occur at the cranial aspect and compressive strains occur at the caudal aspect while the horse is standing, which is useful for fracture fixation.},

  abstract = {Background: One of the great unresolved controversies in paleobiology is whether extinct dinosaurs were endothermic, ectothermic, or some combination thereof, and when endothermy first evolved in the lineage leading to birds. Although it is well established that high, sustained growth rates and, presumably, high activity levels are ancestral for dinosaurs and pterosaurs (clade Ornithodira), other independent lines of evidence for high metabolic rates, locomotor costs, or endothermy are needed. For example, some studies have suggested that, because large dinosaurs may have been homeothermic due to their size alone and could have had heat loss problems, ectothermy would be a more plausible metabolic strategy for such animals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we describe two new biomechanical approaches for reconstructing the metabolic rate of 14 extinct bipedal dinosauriforms during walking and running. These methods, well validated for extant animals, indicate that during walking and slow running the metabolic rate of at least the larger extinct dinosaurs exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities of modern ectotherms, falling instead within the range of modern birds and mammals. Estimated metabolic rates for smaller dinosaurs are more ambiguous, but generally approach or exceed the ectotherm boundary. Conclusions/Significance: Our results support the hypothesis that endothermy was widespread in at least larger non-avian dinosaurs. It was plausibly ancestral for all dinosauriforms (perhaps Ornithodira), but this is perhaps more strongly indicated by high growth rates than by locomotor costs. The polarity of the evolution of endothermy indicates that rapid growth, insulation, erect postures, and perhaps aerobic power predated advanced "avian" lung structure and high locomotor costs. © 2009 Pontzer et al.}

  abstract = {Most of Australia’s sheep rangelands are enclosed by a dingo-proof fence. Within these rangelands, where dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) are rare, red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) are considered to be food limited because their numbers respond to fluctuations in pasture biomass that are driven by highly variable rainfall. Outside this region, where dingoes are common, kangaroo densities are generally substantially lower, suggesting that dingoes are an important limiting factor. However, it is unclear whether dingoes can regulate kangaroo populations. In this study, red kangaroo and emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) numbers were monitored for varying periods during 1978–92 by aerial survey on both sides of the dingo fence in three areas in the north of the South Australian pastoral zone. Densities of red kangaroos and emus were lower outside the fence, although the disparity varied between areas and over time. The similarity in the environments on both sides of the fence and the marked step in kangaroo density at the fence are consistent with dingoes strongly limiting these prey populations. In the north-east of the pastoral zone, where kangaroo and emu densities are greatest, the contrast in density across the fence was most pronounced. Furthermore, the trends in density over time differed across the fence. Outside the fence, red kangaroos and emus remained at low densities following drought as dingo numbers increased. Inside the fence, red kangaroo and emu populations showed a ‘typical’ post-drought recovery. The data therefore suggest that, in some situations, dingoes may not simply limit red kangaroo and emu populations, but also regulate them. For this to occur, predation rate would need to be density dependent at low prey densities. The availability of alternative prey, and the reduction in the numbers of all prey during drought may provide the mechanism.},

In contrast, neither Mef2a nor Mef2d is required for normal skeletal muscle development in vivo. Skeletal muscle deficient in Mef2c differentiates and forms normal myofibers during embryogenesis, but myofibers rapidly deteriorate after birth due to disorganized sarcomeres and a loss of integrity of the M line. Microarray analysis of Mef2c null muscles identified several muscle structural genes that depend on MEF2C, including those encoding the M-line-specific proteins myomesin and M protein. We show that MEF2C directly regulates myomesin gene transcription and that loss of Mef2c in skeletal muscle results in improper sarcomere organization. These results reveal a key role for Mef2c in maintenance of sarcomere integrity and postnatal maturation of skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {The patterns of muscle mass distribution along the lengths of limbs may have important effects on the mechanics and energetics of quadrupedalism. Specifically, Myers and Steudel (J. Morphol. 234 (1997) 183) have shown that fore- and hindlimb Natural Pendular Periods (NPPs) may affect quadrupedal kinematics and must converge to reduce locomotor energetic costs. This study quantifies patterns of limb mass distribution in a live sample of Papio cynocephalus using limb inertial properties (mass, center of mass, mass moment of inertia, and radius of gyration). These inertial properties are calculated using a geometric modeling technique similar to that of Crompton et al. (Am. J. phys. Anthrop. 99 (1996) 547). The inertial properties in Papio are compared to those of Canis from Myers and Steudel (J. Morphol. 234 (1997) 183). The Papio sample has convergent fore- and hindlimb NPPs. Additionally. these limb NPPs are relatively large compared to those of Canis due to the relatively distally distributed limb mass in the Papio sample (relatively large limb masses, relatively distal centers of mass and radii of gyration, and relatively large limb mass moments of inertia). This relatively distal limb mass appears related to the grasping abilities of their hands and feet. Causal links are explored between limb shape adaptations for grasping hands and feet and the kinematics of primate quadrupedalism. In particular, if primates in general follow Papio's limb mass distribution pattern, then relatively large limb NPPs may lead to the relatively low stride frequencies already documented for primates. The kinematics of primate quadrupedalism appears to have been strongly influenced by both selection for grasping hands and feet and selection for reduced locomotor energetic costs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Owing to their cursorial background, ostriches (Struthio camelus) walk and run with high metabolic economy, can reach very fast running speeds and quickly execute cutting manoeuvres. These capabilities are believed to be a result of their ability to coordinate muscles to take advantage of specialized passive limb structures. This study aimed to infer the functional roles of ostrich pelvic limb muscles during gait. Existing gait data were combined with a newly developed musculoskeletal model to generate simulations of ostrich walking and running that predict muscle excitations, force and mechanical work. Consistent with previous avian electromyography studies, predicted excitation patterns showed that individual muscles tended to be excited primarily during only stance or swing. Work and force estimates show that ostrich gaits are partially hip-driven with the bi-articular hip-knee muscles driving stance mechanics. Conversely, the knee extensors acted as brakes, absorbing energy. The digital extensors generated large amounts of both negative and positive mechanical work, with increased magnitudes during running, providing further evidence that ostriches make extensive use of tendinous elastic energy storage to improve economy. The simulations also highlight the need to carefully consider non-muscular soft tissues that may play a role in ostrich gait.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The telemetered electromyographic activity (EMG) of select hindlimb muscles of unrestrained cats during standing, walking, trotting, and galloping have been recorded. Simultaneous cinematographic records permitted close correlation of muscle activity and locomotor behavior. In general, the pattern of extensor activity of the ankle, knee, and hip during locomotion is fairly consistent, while that of the flexors is more variable.                            Changes in basic EMG patterns from walk, to trot, to gallop are most evident in the two‐jointed muscles associated with the knee and hip. Progressively greater variation of activity onset and cessation can be seen among extensor muscle groups from the walk, to trot, to gallop. Co‐activation of the joint extensors and flexors, especially of the hip, at the end of the stance phase (E               3               ) is slight in the walk, moderate in the trot, and considerable in the gallop. These EMG changes are necessary to meet the demands imposed upon the musculature at the faster gaits, particularly galloping, which include limb rigidity as related to loading, momentum as related to the limb's directional change from the stance phase to the swing phase, and lower spinal movements.                          The peroneal muscles of the ankle and the gluteal muscles of the hip show extensor activity and act as joint stabilizers during locomotion. Both biceps femoris anterior muscle and biceps femoris posterior muscle show consistent hip extensor patterns at all gaits. During quiet standing, extensor activity about the knee, ankle, and metatarsophalangeal joints is evident; but the hip extensor and flexor musculature is remarkably silent.             EMG data for unrestrained cats are compared to those of dogs on a treadmill (Tokuriki, '73a,b, '74; Wentink, '76) and those recorded from decerebrate cats (mesencephalic preparation) during controlled locomotion (Gambaryan et al., '71). The EMG patterns from decerebrate cats are more consistent at the walk and gallop within functional groups of muscles at the ankle, knee, and hip than the EMG patterns observed in unrestrained cats or animals moving on a treadmill.},

Since the collapse phenomenon (and interventions to prevent it) involve mechanical processes, it is important to elucidate the similarities and differences of emus versus humans in terms of hip joint biomechanics. A first step for comparison is the intrinsic mechanical properties of the respective bone tissues, as reflected in cortical bone flexural stiffness and strength. In four-point bending, emu cortical bone was found to have an elastic modulus of 13.1 GPa. Its yield stress was determined to be 113 MPa and the ultimate strength was 146 MPa. Emu cortical bone's elastic modulus was similar to that of other avian species, and falls approximately 25\% below that of the human (17.3 GPa).},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Crocodilians are unusual among quadrupedal tetrapods in their frequent use of a wide variety of hindlimb postures, ranging from sprawling to a more erect high walk. In this study, we use synchronized kinematic videos and electromyographic recordings to test how the activity patterns of hindlimb muscles in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis Daudin)differ between sprawling and more upright postures.             Previous force platform analyses suggested that upright posture in alligators would require greater activation by hindlimb extensors to counter increases in the flexor moments exerted about joints by the ground reaction force during upright stance. Consistent with these predictions, ankle extensors (gastrocnemius) and knee extensors (femorotibialis internus and iliotibialis 2) exhibit increases in signal intensity during the use of more upright stance. Bone loading data also predicted that activation patterns for hip adductors spanning the length of the femur would not differ between sprawling and more upright posture. Correspondingly, motor patterns of the adductor femoris were not altered as posture became more upright. However, the adductor puboischiofemoralis externus 3, which inserts far proximally on the femur, displays significant increases in burst intensity that could contribute to the greater femoral adduction that is integral to upright posture.             In contrast to patterns in alligators, in mammals EMG burst intensity typically decreases during the use of upright posture. This difference in the motor control of limb posture between these taxa may be related to differences in the relative sizes of their feet. Alligator feet are large relative to the hindlimb and, as a result, the ground reaction force shifts farther from the limb joints during upright steps than in mammals, increasing flexor moments at joints and requiring alligator extensor muscles to exert greater forces to keep the limb in equilibrium. However, several alligator hindlimb muscles show no differences in motor pattern between sprawling and upright posture. The wide range of motor pattern modulations between different postures in alligators suggests considerable independence of neural control among the muscles of the alligator hindlimb.},

  abstract = {We examined whether elephants shift to using bouncing (i.e. running) mechanics at any speed. To do this, we measured the three-dimensional centre of mass (CM) motions and torso rotations of African and Asian elephants using a novel multisensor method. Hundreds of continuous stride cycles were recorded in the field. African and Asian elephants moved very similarly. Near the mechanically and metabolically optimal speed (a Froude number (Fr) of 0.09), an inverted pendulum mechanism predominated. With increasing speed, the locomotor dynamics quickly but continuously became less like vaulting and more like bouncing. Our mechanical energy analysis of the CM suggests that at a surprisingly slow speed (approx. 2.2{$\mkern1mu$}m{$\mkern1mu$}s               −1               , Fr 0.25), the hindlimbs exhibited bouncing, not vaulting, mechanics during weight support. We infer that a gait transition happens at this relatively slow speed: elephants begin using their compliant hindlimbs like pogo sticks to some extent to drive the body, bouncing over their relatively stiff, vaulting forelimbs.

  abstract = {Knowledge of vertical motion patterns of the axial body segments is a prerequisite for the development of algorithms used in automated detection of lameness. To date, the focus has been on the trot. This study investigates the temporal synchronization between vertical motion of the axial body segments with limb kinematic events in walk and trot across three popular types of sport horses (19 Warmbloods, 23 Iberians, 26 Icelandics) that are known to have different stride kinematics, and it presents novel data describing vertical motion of the axial body segments in tölting and pacing Icelandic horses. Inertial measurement unit sensors recorded limb kinematics, vertical motion of the axial body at all symmetrical gaits that the horse could perform (walk, trot, tölt, pace). Limb kinematics, vertical range of motion and lowest/highest positions of the head, withers and pelvis were calculated. For all gaits except walk and pace, lowest/highest positions of the pelvis and withers were found to be closely related temporally to midstance and start of suspension of the hind/fore quarter, respectively. There were differences in pelvic/withers range of motion between all breeds where the Icelandic horses showed the smallest motion, which may explain why lameness evaluation in this breed is challenging.},

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and the suspensory ligament (SL) of the hindlimb of the horse were studied in vitro. The tendons were observed at several morphologically distinct sites. The loaded tendon is homogeneously strained, in spite of large variations in cross-sectional area. Consequently the modulus of elasticity was inversely proportional to the corresponding cross-sectional area and ranged from 738 MPa (megaPascal, N mm-2) to 1398 MPa within the DDFT, from 1000 MPa to 1282 MPa within the SDFT and from 576 MPa to 669 MPa within the SL. The collagen content was inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area and proportional to the modulus of elasticity. This stresses the influence of tendon composition on the mechanical properties, and also demonstrates the difficulty in judging the strength of a particular tendon or site within a tendon from its cross-sectional area. The respective tendons ruptured at strains of 10.0 per cent (DDFT), 12.3 per cent (SDFT) and 11.0 per cent (SL). The influence of strain rate on the modulus of elasticity is small, and these tendons may therefore be considered as non-linear elastic structures. The average hysteresis is about 5 per cent.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Similarly sized bipeds and quadrupeds use nearly the same amount of metabolic energy to run, despite dramatic differences in morphology and running mechanics. It has been shown that the rate of metabolic energy use in quadrupedal runners and bipedal hoppers can be predicted from just body weight and the time available to generate force as indicated by the duration of foot–ground contact. We tested whether this link between running mechanics and energetics also applies to running bipeds. We measured rates of energy consumption and times of foot contact for humans (mean body mass 78.88 kg) and five species of birds (mean body mass range 0.13–40.1 kg). We find that most (70–90 \%) of the increase in metabolic rate with speed in running bipeds can be explained by changes in the time available to generate force. The rate of force generation also explains differences in metabolic rate over the size range of birds measured. However, for a given rate of force generation, birds use on average 1.7 times more metabolic energy than quadrupeds. The rate of energy consumption for a given rate of force generation for humans is intermediate between that of birds and quadrupeds. These results support the idea that the cost of muscular force production determines the energy cost of running and suggest that bipedal runners use more energy for a given rate of force production because they require a greater volume of muscle to support their body weight.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             We tested the hypothesis that the hindlimb muscles of wild turkeys(Meleagris gallopavo) can produce maximal power during running accelerations. The mechanical power developed during single running steps was calculated from force-plate and high-speed video measurements as turkeys accelerated over a trackway. Steady-speed running steps and accelerations were compared to determine how turkeys alter their running mechanics from a low-power to a high-power gait. During maximal accelerations, turkeys eliminated two features of running mechanics that are characteristic of steady-speed running: (i) they produced purely propulsive horizontal ground reaction forces, with no braking forces, and (ii) they produced purely positive work during stance, with no decrease in the mechanical energy of the body during the step. The braking and propulsive forces ordinarily developed during steady-speed running are important for balance because they align the ground reaction force vector with the center of mass. Increases in acceleration in turkeys correlated with decreases in the angle of limb protraction at toe-down and increases in the angle of limb retraction at toe-off. These kinematic changes allow turkeys to maintain the alignment of the center of mass and ground reaction force vector during accelerations when large propulsive forces result in a forward-directed ground reaction force. During the highest accelerations, turkeys produced exclusively positive mechanical power. The measured power output during acceleration divided by the total hindlimb muscle mass yielded estimates of peak instantaneous power output in excess of 400 W kg-1 hindlimb muscle mass. This value exceeds estimates of peak instantaneous power output of turkey muscle fibers. The mean power developed during the entire stance phase increased from approximately zero during steady-speed runs to more than 150 W kg-1muscle during the highest accelerations. The high power outputs observed during accelerations suggest that elastic energy storage and recovery may redistribute muscle power during acceleration. Elastic mechanisms may expand the functional range of muscle contractile elements in running animals by allowing muscles to vary their mechanical function from force-producing struts during steady-speed running to power-producing motors during acceleration.},

During level running, the active muscle shortens little and performs little work but provides the force necessary to support body weight economically. Running economy is improved by muscles that act as active struts rather than working machines.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Although a large number of foot-fall sequences are possible in quadrupeds,few sequences are routinely used. The aim of this paper is to characterise, by foot-fall pattern, the gaits used by horses and develop a novel technique to classify symmetric and asymmetric gaits using one common criterion. To achieve this speed and relative foot-fall, timings of all four limbs of eight Icelandic horses were measured using accelerometers. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to find criteria that are optimal for discriminating between the different gaits. This also allowed us to evaluate whether gaits should be considered a continuum or as discrete entities. Foot-fall timings (stance times, swing times, duty factors and stride frequencies) for walk, tolt, trot, pace, left canter, right canter, left gallop and right gallop during over-ground locomotion at a range of speeds are presented. In the gaits of walk, tolt, trot and pace, foot-fall timings were equal between left and right hindlimbs and forelimbs so these gaits can be considered as symmetrical. Differences in stance times and duty factors were observed between gaits but are unlikely to be of biological significance due to their similar magnitude and inconsistent relative trends. This implies that metabolics or peak limb forces derived from contact times are unlikely to be the principal driving factors in gait transition between walk, trot, pace,canters and gallops, although these factors may influence the use of tolt at the lower and higher speeds. Gaits did cluster in the LDA space and the running gaits (tolt, trot, pace, left and right canters and gallops) could be considered a kinematic continuum but the relative relationship with walk may be more complex. Thus, LDA analysis has enabled common criteria to be discovered to accurately classify equine gaits on the basis of foot-fall timings on a stride-by-stride basis.},

  abstract = {1. To explore how maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) of fibres varies within one muscle and how Vmax varies with body size, we measured Vmax of muscle fibres from soleus muscle of a large animal, the horse. 2. Vmax was determined by the slack test on skinned single muscle fibres at 15 degrees C during maximal activation (pCa = 5.2). The fibre type was subsequently determined by a combination of single‐cell histochemistry and gel electrophoresis of the myosin light chains. 3. Vmax values for the type I, IIA and IIB muscle fibres were 0.33 +/‐ 0.04 muscle lengths/s (ML/s) (+/‐ S.E.M., n = 6), 1.33 +/‐ 0.08 ML/s (n = 7) and 3.20 +/‐ 0.26 ML/s (n = 6), respectively. It is likely that the large range in Vmax is due to differences observed in the myosin heavy chains and light chains associated with the three fibre types. 4. Comparison of Vmax over a 1200‐fold range (450 kg horse vs. 0.38 kg rat) of body mass (Mb) suggests that slow fibres scale more dramatically (Mb‐0.18) than do fast glycolytic fibres (Mb‐0.07). This difference may enable the slow fibres to work at high efficiencies in the large animal while the fast fibres can still generate a large mechanical power when necessary.},

This review aims to explore the involvement of MuRF-1 and MAFbx in catabolism of skeletal muscle during various pathologies, such as cancer cachexia, sarcopenia of aging, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, the effects of various lifestyle and modifiable factors (e.g. nutrition, exercise, cigarette smoking, and alcohol) on MuRF-1 and MAFbx regulation will be discussed. Finally, evidence of potential strategies to protect against skeletal muscle wasting through inhibition of MuRF-1 and MAFbx expression will be explored.},

  abstract = {In order to perform external work, muscles must do additional internal work to deform their tissue, and in particular, to overcome the inertia due to their internal mass. However, the contribution of the internal mass within a muscle to the mechanical output of that muscle has only rarely been studied. Here, we use a dynamic, multi-element Hill-type muscle model to examine the effects of the inertial mass within muscle on its contractile performance. We find that the maximum strain-rate of muscle is slower for lower activations and larger muscle sizes. As muscle size increases, the ability of the muscle to overcome its inertial load will decrease, as muscle tension is proportional to cross-sectional area and inertial load is proportional to mass. Thus, muscles that are larger in size will have a higher inertial cost to contraction. Similarly, when muscle size and inertial load are held constant, decreasing muscle activation will increase inertial cost to contraction by reducing muscle tension. These results show that inertial loads within muscle contribute to a slowing of muscle contractile velocities (strain-rates), particularly at the submaximal activations that are typical during animal locomotion.},

Yet, if asked to draw a picture of Tyrannosaurus rex, most of these students will likely draw an animal with an upright, tail-dragging posture, remarkably like the original 1905 description of this famous dinosaur. We documented this phenomenon by asking college (n = 111) and elementary to middle school students (n = 143) to draw pictures of T. rex. On each drawing, we measured the angle of the spine from a horizontal surface. An average angle of 50–60° was found in drawings from all ages, which is within about 5° of the 1905 posture at 57°. This is in striking contrast to images created by modern dinosaur scientists, which average between 0 and 10°. In an effort to explain this pattern, we measured T. rex images in a wide variety of popular books, most of them for children, published from the 1940s to today. Since 1970, a gradually increasi...},

A set of fused hadrosaur vertebrae allowed that hypothesis to be tested. The Tyrannosaurus rex responsible for this pathology did not escape unscathed. It left behind a tooth crown that had fractured. Fragments of that tooth were scattered through the intervertebral space, evidencing that there was no solid structure to impede its movement. That eliminates the possibility of an intervertebral disc and instead proves the presence of an articular space, similar to that in modern reptiles, but at variance to what is noted in birds. While avian cervical vertebral centra appear to be separated by diarthrodial joints, the preponderance of their thoracic vertebral centra is not separated by synovial joints.},

  abstract = {This study, focused on the laryngeal source level, introduces the concept of laryngeal vibratory mechanism. Human phonation is characterized by the use of four laryngeal mechanisms, labeled M0-M3, as evidenced by the electroglottographic (EGG) study of the transition phenomena between mechanisms with a population of men and women, trained and untrained singers. Macroscopic and local descriptions of the EGG signal are analyzed during the production of glissandos and held notes with different mechanisms. The transition from one mechanism to another of higher rank is characterized by a jump in frequency, a reduction of EGG amplitude, and a change in the shape of the derivative of the EGG (which may correspond to a reduction of the vibratory mass). These characteristics are used to identify a transition between two mechanisms, in complement with acoustic spectrographic analyses. The pitches of transitions between the two main mechanisms M1 and M2 and the range of the frequency-overlap region are described in detail. The notion of vocal register is revisited in the light of these concepts of laryngeal mechanism. The literature on vocal registers is reviewed, and it is shown that the confusion often cited with respect to this notion may be related to the heterogeneity of the approaches and methods used to describe the phenomena and to the multiplicity of descriptors. Therefore, the terminology of the registers is organized depending on their relation to the four laryngeal vibratory mechanisms. © 2009 The Voice Foundation.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanical adaptations linked to economical locomotion in cursorial bipeds. We addressed this question by comparing mass-matched humans and avian bipeds (ostriches), which exhibit marked differences in limb structure and running economy. We hypothesized that the nearly 50 per cent lower energy cost of running in ostriches is a result of: (i) lower limb-swing mechanical power, (ii) greater stance-phase storage and release of elastic energy, and (iii) lower total muscle power output. To test these hypotheses, we used three-dimensional joint mechanical measurements and a simple model to estimate the elastic and muscle contributions to joint work and power. Contradictory to our first hypothesis, we found that ostriches and humans generate the same amounts of mechanical power to swing the limbs at a similar self-selected running speed, indicating that limb swing probably does not contribute to the difference in energy cost of running between these species. In contrast, we estimated that ostriches generate 120 per cent more stance-phase mechanical joint power via release of elastic energy compared with humans. This elastic mechanical power occurs nearly exclusively at the tarsometatarso-phalangeal joint, demonstrating a shift of mechanical power generation to distal joints compared with humans. We also estimated that positive muscle fibre power is 35 per cent lower in ostriches compared with humans, and is accounted for primarily by higher capacity for storage and release of elastic energy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed much larger frontal and internal/external rotation joint loads during ostrich running than in humans. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that a primary limb structure specialization linked to economical running in cursorial species is an elevated storage and release of elastic energy in tendon. In the ostrich, energy-saving specializations may also include passive frontal and internal/external rotation load-bearing mechanisms.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Although locomotor kinematics in walking and running birds have been examined in studies exploring many biological aspects of bipedalism, these studies have been largely limited to two-dimensional analyses. Incorporating a five-segment, 17 degree-of-freedom (d.f.) kinematic model of the ostrich hind limb developed from anatomical specimens, we quantified the three-dimensional(3-D) joint axis alignment and joint kinematics during running (at ∼3.3 m s–1) in the largest avian biped, the ostrich. Our analysis revealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrich occurs in flexion/extension. Importantly, however, the alignment of the average flexion/extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotated externally to the direction of travel (37° and 21°, respectively) so that pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct the tibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement, and pure flexion and extension at the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to the plane of movement. This feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide the major lateral (non-sagittal) displacement of the lower limb necessary for steering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what would otherwise require greater adduction/abduction and/or internal/external rotation, allowing for less complex joints, musculoskeletal geometry and neuromuscular control. Significant rotation about the joints'non-flexion/extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride. In particular, hip abduction and knee internal/external and varus/valgus motion may further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase, and substantial non-flexion/extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance. Measurement of 3-D segment and joint motion in birds will be aided by the use of functionally determined axes of rotation rather than assumed axes, proving important when interpreting the biomechanics and motor control of avian bipedalism.},

But do these different methods of assessing disparity provide comparable results? Here we provide evidence that all metrics correlate significantly with each other and capture similar patterns of morphological variation. We compare three methods of capturing morphological disparity (discrete characters, geometric morphometric outlines and geometric morphometric landmarks) in coelurosaurian dinosaurs. We standardize our study by focusing all our metrics on the mandible, so avoiding the risk of confounding disparity methods with anatomical coverage of the taxa. The correlation is strongest between the two geometric morphometric methods, and weaker between the morphometric methods and the discrete characters. By using phylogenetic simulations of discrete character and geometric morphometric data sets, we show that the strength of these correlations is significantly greater than expected from the evolution of random data under Brownian motion. All disparity metrics confirm that Maniraptoriformes had the highest disparity of all coelurosaurians, and~omnivores and herbivores had higher disparity than carnivores.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The ostrich is highly specialized in terrestrial locomotion and is the only extant bird that is both didactyl and exhibits a permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint. This extreme degree of digitigrady provides an excellent opportunity for the study of phalangeal adaptation towards fast, sustained bipedal locomotion. Data were gathered in a semi-natural setting with hand-raised, cooperative specimens. Dynamic pressure distribution, centre of pressure (CoP) trajectory and the positional inter-relationship of the toes during stance phase were investigated using pedobarography. Walking and running trials shared a J-shaped CoP trajectory with greater localization of CoP origin as speed increased. Slight variations of 4th toe position in walking affect CoP origin and modulation of 4th toe pressure on the substrate allows correction of balance, primarily at the beginning of stance phase at lower speeds. Load distribution patterns differed significantly between slow and fast trials. In walking, the 3rd and particularly the 4th toe exhibited notable variation in load distribution with minor claw participation only at push-off. Running trials yielded a distinctly triangular load distribution pattern defined by the 4th toe tip, the proximal part of the 3rd toe and the claw tip, with the sharp point of the claw providing an essential traction element at push-off. Consistency of CoP trajectory and load distribution at higher speeds arises from dynamic stability effects and may also reflect stringent limitations to degrees of freedom in hindlimb joint articulation that contribute to locomotor efficiency. This novel research could aid in the reconstruction of theropod locomotor modes and offers a systemic approach for future avian pedobarographic investigations.},

  abstract = {Better running economy (i.e. a lower rate of energy consumption at a given speed) is correlated with superior distance running performance. There is substantial variation in running economy, even among elite runners. This variation might be due to variation in the storage and reutilization of elastic energy in tendons. Using a simple musculoskeletal model, it was predicted that the amount of energy stored in a tendon during a given movement depends more critically on moment arm than on mechanical properties of the tendon, with the amount of stored energy increasing as the moment arm gets smaller. Assuming a link between elastic energy reutilization and overall metabolic cost of running, a smaller moment arm should therefore be associated with superior running economy. This prediction was confirmed experimentally in a group of 15 highly trained runners. The moment arm of the Achilles tendon was determined from standardized photographs of the ankle, using the position of anatomical landmarks. Running economy was measured as the rate of metabolic energy consumption during level treadmill running at a speed of 16 km h-1. A strong correlation was found between the moment arm of the Achilles tendon and running economy. Smaller muscle moment arms correlated with lower rates of metabolic energy consumption (r2=0.75, P{$<$}0.001).},

  abstract = {Vertical jumping was used to assess muscle mechanical output in bonobos and comparisons were drawn to human jumping. Jump height, defined as the vertical displacement of the body centre of mass during the airborne phase, was determined for three bonobos of varying age and sex. All bonobos reached jump heights above 0.7{$\mkern1mu$}m, which greatly exceeds typical human maximal performance (0.3–0.4{$\mkern1mu$}m). Jumps by one male bonobo (34{$\mkern1mu$}kg) and one human male (61.5{$\mkern1mu$}kg) were analysed using an inverse dynamics approach. Despite the difference in size, the mechanical output delivered by the bonobo and the human jumper during the push-off was similar: about 450{$\mkern1mu$}J, with a peak power output close to 3000{$\mkern1mu$}W. In the bonobo, most of the mechanical output was generated at the hips. To account for the mechanical output, the muscles actuating the bonobo's hips (directly and indirectly) must deliver muscle-mass-specific power and work output of 615{$\mkern1mu$}W{$\mkern1mu$}kg               −1               and 92{$\mkern1mu$}J{$\mkern1mu$}kg               −1               , respectively. This was twice the output expected on the basis of muscle mass specific work and power in other jumping animals but seems physiologically possible. We suggest that the difference is due to a higher specific force (force per unit of cross-sectional area) in the bonobo.},

  abstract = {In Asia, flexible bamboo poles are routinely used to carry substantial loads on the shoulder. Various advantages have been attributed to this load-carrying strategy (e.g. reduced energy consumption), but experimental evidence remains inconsistent – possibly because carriers in previous studies were inexperienced. Theoretical models typically neglect the individual’s capacity to optimize interactions with the oscillating load, leaving the complete dynamics underexplored. This study used a trajectory optimization model to predict gait adaptations that minimize work-based costs associated with carrying compliant loads and compared the outcomes with naturally selected gait adaptations of experienced pole carriers. Gait parameters and load interactions (e.g. relative amplitude and frequency, phase) were measured in rural farmworkers in Vietnam. Participants carried a range of loads with compliant and rigid poles and the energetic consequences of step frequency adjustments were evaluated using the model. When carrying large loads, the empirical step frequency changes associated with pole type (compliant versus rigid) were largely consistent with model predictions, in terms of direction (increase or decrease) and magnitude (by how much). Work-minimizing strategies explain changes in leg compliance, harmonic frequency oscillations and fluctuations in energetic cost associated with carrying loads on a compliant bamboo pole.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Synopsis Tails are a defining characteristic of chordates and show enormous diversity in function and shape. Although chordate tails share a common evolutionary and genetic-developmental origin, tails are extremely versatile in morphology and function. For example, tails can be short or long, thin or thick, and feathered or spiked, and they can be used for propulsion, communication, or balancing, and they mediate in predator–prey outcomes. Depending on the species of animal the tail is attached to, it can have extraordinarily multi-functional purposes. Despite its morphological diversity and broad functional roles, tails have not received similar scientific attention as, for example, the paired appendages such as legs or fins. This forward-looking review article is a first step toward interdisciplinary scientific synthesis in tail research. We discuss the importance of tail research in relation to five topics: (1) evolution and development, (2) regeneration, (3) functional morphology, (4) sensorimotor control, and (5) computational and physical models. Within each of these areas, we highlight areas of research and combinations of long-standing and new experimental approaches to move the field of tail research forward. To best advance a holistic understanding of tail evolution and function, it is imperative to embrace an interdisciplinary approach, re-integrating traditionally siloed fields around discussions on tail-related research.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Recent studies of in vivo muscle function in guinea fowl revealed that distal leg muscles rapidly modulate force and work to stabilize running in uneven terrain. Previous studies focused on running only, and it remains unclear how muscular mechanisms for stability differ between walking and running. Here, we investigated in vivo function of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) during walking over obstacles. We compared muscle function in birds with intact (iLG) versus self-reinnervated LG (rLG). Self-reinnervation results in proprioceptive feedback deficit due to loss of monosynaptic stretch reflex. We tested the hypothesis that proprioceptive deficit results in decreased modulation of EMG activity in response to obstacle contact, and a delayed obstacle recovery compared with that for iLG. We found that total myoelectric intensity (Etot) of iLG increased by 68\% in obstacle strides (S~0) compared with level terrain, suggesting a substantial reflex-mediated response. In contrast, Etot of rLG increased by 31\% in S~0 strides compared with level walking, but also increased by 43\% in the first post-obstacle (S~+1) stride. In iLG, muscle force and work differed significantly from level walking only in the S~0 stride, indicating a single-stride recovery. In rLG, force increased in S~0, S~+1 and S~+2 compared with level walking, indicating three-stride obstacle recovery. Interestingly, rLG showed little variation in work output and shortening velocity in obstacle terrain, indicating a shift towards near-isometric strut-like function. Reinnervated birds also adopted a more crouched posture across level and obstacle terrains compared with intact birds. These findings suggest gait-specific control mechanisms in walking and running.},

Namely, measures of external joint work do not provide information on the contributions from individual muscles or in-series elastic structures. In this study, we examined the functional roles of a major ankle extensor muscle, the lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and a major knee extensor muscle, the vastus lateralis (VL), through in vivo sonomicrometry and electromyography techniques, during vertical jumping by kangaroo rats. Our data showed that both muscles increased shortening and activity with higher jumps. We found that knee angular velocity and VL muscle shortening velocity were coupled in time. In contrast, the ankle angular velocity and LG muscle shortening velocity were decoupled, and rapid joint extension near the end of the jump produced high power outputs at the ankle joint. Further, the decoupling of muscle and joint kinematics allowed the LG muscle to prolong the period of shortening velocity near optimal velocity, which likely enabled the muscle to sustain maximal power generation. These observations were consistent with an LG tendon that is much more compliant than that of the VL.},

Limb force increases with speed but direct measures of limb ground reaction forces (GRFs) at gallop are sparse.

The results show peak vertical GRF values of 13.6\>N\>kg−1 (non-lead hindlimb), 12.3\>N\>kg−1 (lead hindlimb), 14.0\>N\>kg−1 (non-lead forelimb) and 13.6\>N\>kg−1 (lead forelimb) at 11.4\>m\>s−1 and recorded values are consistent with those predicted from duty factor. The distribution of body weight between the forelimbs and hindlimbs is approximated to 50:50, and is variable with speed, unlike the 60:40 commonly stated for cursorial quadrupeds in the literature. An even distribution of load on all limbs may help minimise accumulation of fatigue and assist in injury avoidance. Cranio-caudal force data concur with the observation that horses apply a net accelerative impulse with the hindlimbs and a net decelerative impulse with the forelimbs. Capturing GRFs enhances our knowledge on the mechanics of galloping in fast-moving species and provides insight into injury risk and factors limiting athletic performance.},

  abstract = {Maximum running speed is an important locomotor parameter for many animals—predators as well as prey—and is thus of interest to palaeobiologists wishing to reconstruct the behavioural ecology of extinct species. A variety of approaches have been tried in the past including anatomical comparisons, bone scaling and strength, safety factors and ground reaction force analyses. However, these approaches are all indirect and an alternative approach is to create a musculoskeletal model of the animal and see how fast it can run. The major advantage of this approach is that all assumptions about the animal's morphology and physiology are directly addressed, whereas the exact same assumptions are hidden in the indirect approaches. In this paper, we present simple musculoskeletal models of three extant and five extinct bipedal species. The models predict top speed in the extant species with reasonably good agreement with accepted values, so we conclude that the values presented for the five extinct species are reasonable predictions given the modelling assumptions made. Improved musculoskeletal models and better estimates of soft tissue parameters will produce more accurate values. Limited sensitivity analysis is performed on key muscle parameters but there is considerable scope for extending this in the future.},

  abstract = {Primates are unusual among terrestrial quadrupedal mammals in that at walking speeds they prefer diagonal rather than lateral gaits. A number of reasons have been proposed for this preference in relation to the arboreal ancestry of modern primates: stability, energetic cost, neural control, skeletal loading, and limb interference avoiding. However, this is a difficult question to explore experimentally since most primates only occasionally use anything other than diagonal gaits. An alternative approach is to produce biologically realistic computer simulations of primate gait that enable the constraints of biomechanical loading and the energetics of different modes of locomotion to be explored. In this paper we describe such a model for the chimpanzee               Pan troglodytes               . The simulation is able to produce spontaneous quadrupedal locomotion, and the footfall sequences generated are split between lateral and diagonal footfall sequences with no obvious energetic benefit associated with either option. However, out of 10 successful simulation runs, 5 were lateral sequence/lateral couplet gaits indicating a preference for a specific lateral footfall sequence with a relatively tightly constrained phase difference between the fore- and hindlimbs. This suggests that the choice of diagonal walking gaits in chimpanzees is not a simple mechanical phenomenon and that diagonal walking gaits in primates are selected for by multiple factors.}

  abstract = {Sauropod dinosaurs are the largest terrestrial vertebrate to have lived on Earth. This size must have posed special challenges for the musculoskeletal system. Scaling theory shows that body mass and hence the loads that must be overcome increases with body size more rapidly than either the ability of the muscles to generate force, or the ability of the skeleton to support these loads. Here we demonstrate how one of the very largest sauropods, Argentinosaurus huinculensis (40 metres long, weighing 83 tonnes), may have moved. A musculoskeletal model was generated using data captured by laser scanning a mounted skeleton and assigning muscle properties based on comparative data from living animals. Locomotion is generated using forward dynamic simulation to calculate the accelerations produced by the muscle forces, coupled with machine learning techniques to find a control pattern that minimises metabolic cost. The simulation demonstrates that at such vast body size, joint range of motion needs to be restricted to allow sufficient force generation for an achievable muscle mass. However when this is done, a perfectly plausible gait can be generated relatively easily. Whilst this model represents the best current simulation of the gait of these giant animals, it is likely that there are as yet unknown mechanical mechanisms, possibly based on passive elastic structures that should be incorporated to increase the efficiency of the animal9s locomotion. It is certainly the case that these would need to be incorporated into the model to properly assess the full locomotor capabilities of the animal.}

Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach where a minimum convex hull is derived mathematically from the point cloud generated by laser-scanning mounted skeletons. This has the advantage of requiring minimal user intervention and is thus more objective and far quicker. We test this method on 14 relatively large-bodied mammalian skeletons and demonstrate that it consistently underestimates body mass by 21 per cent with minimal scatter around the regression line. We therefore suggest that it is a robust method of estimating body mass where a mounted skeletal reconstruction is available and demonstrate its usage to predict the body mass of one of the largest, relatively complete sauropod dinosaurs: Giraffatitan brancai (previously Brachiosaurus) as 23200 kg. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional computational modeling offers tools with which to investigate forces experienced by the skull during feeding and other behaviors. American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) generate some of the highest measured bite forces among extant tetrapods. A concomitant increase in bite force accompanies ontogenetic increases in body mass, which has been linked with dietary changes as animals increase in size. Because the flattened skull of crocodylians has substantial mediolaterally oriented muscles, crocodylians are an excellent model taxon in which to explore the role of mediolateral force components experienced by the feeding apparatus. Many previous modeling studies of archosaur cranial function focused on planar analysis, ignoring the mediolateral aspects of cranial forces. Here, we used three-dimensionally accurate anatomical data to resolve 3D muscle forces. Using dissection, imaging and computational techniques, we developed lever and finite element models of an ontogenetic series of alligators to test the effects of size and shape on cranial loading and compared estimated bite forces with those previously measured in vivo in A. mississippiensis. We found that modeled forces matched in vivo data well for intermediately sized individuals, and somewhat overestimated force in smaller specimens and underestimated force in larger specimens, suggesting that ontogenetically static muscular parameters and bony attachment sites alone cannot account for all the variation in bite force. Adding aponeurotic muscle attachments would likely improve force predictions, but such data are challenging to model and integrate into analyses of extant taxa and are generally unpreserved in fossils. We conclude that anatomically accurate modeling of muscles can be coupled with finite element and lever analyses to produce reliable, reasonably accurate estimate bite forces and thus both skeletal and joint loading, with known sources of error, which can be applied to extinct taxa.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             To understand the evolution of bipedalism among the hominoids in an ecological context we need to be able to estimate the energetic cost of locomotion in fossil forms. Ideally such an estimate would be based entirely on morphology since, except for the rare instances where footprints are preserved, this is the only primary source of evidence available. In this paper we use evolutionary robotics techniques (genetic algorithms, pattern generators and mechanical modeling) to produce a biomimetic simulation of bipedalism based on human body dimensions. The mechanical simulation is a seven-segment, two-dimensional model with motive force provided by tension generators representing the major muscle groups acting around the lower-limb joints. Metabolic energy costs are calculated from the muscle model, and bipedal gait is generated using a finite-state pattern generator whose parameters are produced using a genetic algorithm with locomotor economy(maximum distance for a fixed energy cost) as the fitness criterion. The model is validated by comparing the values it generates with those for modern humans. The result (maximum efficiency of 200 J m–1) is within 15\% of the experimentally derived value, which is very encouraging and suggests that this is a useful analytic technique for investigating the locomotor behaviour of fossil forms. Initial work suggests that in the future this technique could be used to estimate other locomotor parameters such as top speed. In addition, the animations produced by this technique are qualitatively very convincing, which suggests that this may also be a useful technique for visualizing bipedal locomotion.},

Subsequent simulations for               A. afarensis               yield estimates of the range of walking speeds from 0.6 to 1.3{$\mkern1mu$}m{$\mkern1mu$}s               −1               at a cost of 7.0{$\mkern1mu$}J{$\mkern1mu$}kg               −1               {$\mkern1mu$}m               −1               for the lowest speeds, falling to 5.8{$\mkern1mu$}J{$\mkern1mu$}kg               −1               {$\mkern1mu$}m               −1               at 1.0{$\mkern1mu$}m{$\mkern1mu$}s               −1               , and rising to 6.2{$\mkern1mu$}J{$\mkern1mu$}kg               −1               {$\mkern1mu$}m               −1               at the maximum speed achieved. Speeds previously estimated for the makers of the Laetoli footprint trails (0.56 or 0.64{$\mkern1mu$}m{$\mkern1mu$}s               −1               for Trail 1, 0.72 or 0.75{$\mkern1mu$}m{$\mkern1mu$}s               −1               for Trail 2/3) may have been underestimated, substantially so for Trail 2/3, with true values in excess of 0.7 and 1.0{$\mkern1mu$}m{$\mkern1mu$}s               −1               , respectively. The predictions conflict with suggestions that               A. afarensis               used a ‘shuffling’ gait, indicating rather that the species was a fully competent biped.},

  abstract = {Gait reconstruction of extinct animals requires the integration of palaeontological information obtained from fossils with biological knowledge of the anatomy, physiology and biomechanics of extant animals. Computer simulation provides a methodology for combining multimodal information to produce concrete predictions that can be evaluated and used to assess the likelihood of competing locomotor hypotheses. However, with the advent of much faster supercomputers, such simulations can also explore a wider range of possibilities, allowing the generation of gait hypotheses de novo. In this paper we document the use of an 8000 core computer to produce mechanically and physiologically plausible gaits and trackway patterns for a sub-adult dinosaur (Edmontosaurus annectens), evaluating a large range of locomotor possibilities in terms of running speed. The anatomical reconstruction presented is capable of running and hopping bipedal gaits; trot, pace and single foot symmetrical quadrupedal gaits; and asymmetrical galloping gaits. Surprisingly hopping is the fastest gait (17 ms-1), followed by quadrupedal galloping (16 ms-1) and bipedal running (14 ms-1). Such a hopping gait is considered unlikely for this animal, which would imply that either our anatomical and physiological reconstruction is incorrect or there are important constraints such as skeletal loading and safety factor that are currently not included in our simulation. The most likely errors are in joint ranges of motion, combined with the lengths of muscle fibres and tendons since these values are difficult to reconstruct. Thus the process of gait simulation is able to narrow down our predictions of unknown features of the extinct animal using a functional bracket. Trackway geometries derived from the gait models are currently very basic due to the simplicity of the ground/foot contact model used, but demonstrate the future potential of this technology for interpreting and predicting trackway geometry.},

The subject-exoskeleton collaborative movement and its interaction forces can be predicted in silico using computational modeling techniques. We developed an optimal control framework that consisted of three phases. First, the foot-ground (Phase A) and the subject-exoskeleton (Phase B) contact models were calibrated using three experimental sit-to-stand trials. Then, the collaborative movement and the subject-exoskeleton interaction forces, of six different sit-to-stand trials were predicted (Phase C). The results show that the contact models were able to reproduce experimental kinematics of calibration trials (mean root mean square differences - RMSD - coordinates ≤ 1.1° and velocities ≤ 6.8°/s), ground reaction forces (mean RMSD≤ 22.9 N), as well as the interaction forces at the pelvis, thigh, and shank (mean RMSD ≤ 5.4 N). Phase C could predict the collaborative movements of prediction trials (mean RMSD coordinates ≤ 3.5° and velocities ≤ 15.0°/s), and their subject-exoskeleton interaction forces (mean RMSD ≤ 13.1° N). In conclusion, this optimal control framework could be used while designing exoskeletons to have in silico knowledge of new optimal movements and their interaction forces.},

Healthy skeletal muscle harbors a robust regenerative response that becomes inadequate after large muscle loss or in degenerative pathologies and aging. In contrast, the mammalian heart loses its regenerative capacity shortly after birth, leaving it susceptible to permanent damage by acute injury or chronic disease. In this review, we compare and contrast the physiology and regenerative potential of native skeletal and cardiac muscles, mechanisms underlying striated muscle dysfunction, and bioengineering strategies to treat muscle disorders. We focus on different sources for cellular therapy, biomaterials to augment the endogenous regenerative response, and progress in engineering and application of mature striated muscle tissues in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in translating muscle bioengineering strategies to clinical practice.},

While energy efficiency appears to be one of the reasons for changing gaits, other determinant factors likely play a role too, including terrain properties. In this article, we propose that viability, i.e., the avoidance of falls, represents an important criterion for gait transitions. We investigate the emergence of gait transitions through the interaction between supraspinal drive (brain), the central pattern generator in the spinal cord, the body, and exteroceptive sensing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning and robotics tools. Consistent with quadruped animal data, we show that the walk-trot gait transition for quadruped robots on flat terrain improves both viability and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of discrete terrain (i.e., crossing successive gaps) on imposing gait transitions, and find the emergence of trot-pronk transitions to avoid non-viable states. Viability is the only improved factor after gait transitions on both flat and discrete gap terrains, suggesting that viability could be a primary and universal objective of gait transitions, while other criteria are secondary objectives and/or a consequence of viability. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art quadruped robot~agility in challenging scenarios.},

  abstract = {Birds have remarkable flight capabilities due to their adaptive wing morphology. However, studying live birds is time-consuming and laborious, and obtaining information about the complete wingbeat cycle is difficult. To address this issue and provide a complete dataset, we recorded comprehensive motion capture wing trajectory data from five free-flying pigeons (Columba livia). Five key motion parameters are used to quantitatively characterize wing kinematics: flapping, sweeping, twisting, folding and bending. In addition, the forelimb skeleton is mapped using an open-chain three-bar mechanism model. By systematically evaluating the relationship of joint degrees of freedom (DOFs), we configured the model as a 3-DOF shoulder, 1-DOF elbow and 2-DOF wrist. Based on the correlation analysis between wingbeat kinematics and joint movement, we found that the strongly correlated shoulder and wrist roll within the stroke plane cause wing flap and bending. There is also a strong correlation between shoulder, elbow and wrist yaw out of the stroke plane, which causes wing sweep and fold. By simplifying the wing morphing, we developed three flapping wing robots, each with different DOFs inside and outside the stroke plane. This study provides insight into the design of flapping wing robots capable of mimicking the 3D wing motion of pigeons.},

  abstract = {Biomechanics researchers often use multibody models to represent biological systems. However, the mapping from biology to mechanics and back can be problematic. OpenSim is a popular open source tool used for this purpose, mapping between biological specifications and an underlying generalized coordinate multibody system called Simbody. One quantity of interest to biomechanical researchers and clinicians is “muscle moment arm,” a measure of the effectiveness of a muscle at contributing to a particular motion over a range of configurations. OpenSim can automatically calculate these quantities for any muscle once a model has been built. For simple cases, this calculation is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. But a muscle may span several joints (e.g., wrist, neck, back) and may follow a convoluted path over various curved surfaces. A biological joint may require several bodies or even a mechanism to accurately represent in the multibody model (e.g., knee, shoulder). In these situations we need a careful definition of muscle moment arm that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept, yet generalized to be of use to biomedical researchers. Here we present some biomechanical modeling challenges and how they are resolved in OpenSim and Simbody to yield biologically meaningful muscle moment arms.},

Our high-speed video footage in the Southeast Asian rainforest capturing the first recorded, subcritical, short-range glides revealed that geckos did not markedly decrease velocity prior to impact. Unlike specialized gliders, geckos crashed head-first with the tree trunk at 6.0\,±\,0.9\,m/s (\textasciitilde 140 body lengths per second) followed by an enormous pitchback of their head and torso 103\,±\,34° away from the tree trunk anchored by only their hind limbs and tail. A dynamic mathematical model pointed to the utility of tails for the fall arresting response (FAR) upon landing. We tested predictions by measuring foot forces during landing of a soft, robotic physical model with an active tail reflex triggered by forefoot contact. As in wild animals, greater landing success was found for tailed robots. Experiments showed that longer tails with an active tail reflex resulted in the lower adhesive foot forces necessary for stabilizing successful landings, with a tail shortened to 25\% requiring over twice the adhesive foot force.},

  abstract = {Abstract             It has been known for some time (DJ Finney, J. Roy. Stat. Soc. Suppl. 7:155–161, 1941) that transformation of an arithmetic data set to logarithms results in biased estimates when predicted values from a leastsquares regression are detransformed back to arithmetic units. Predicted values are estimates of the geometric mean of the dependent variable at that value of the independent variable, rather than the arithmetic mean. Since the geometric mean is always less than the arithmetic mean, detransformed predictions will underestimate the value in question. This bias affects the interpretations of allometric equations used for estimation, such as predicting fossil body mass from skeletal dimensions, and applications of allometry as a “criterion of subtraction,” in which residual variation is evaluated.             A number of parametric and nonparametric corrections for transformation bias have been developed. Although this problem is relatively unexplored in mammalian morphometrics, it has received considerable attention in other disciplines that use power functions structurally identical to the allometric equation. Insights into transformation bias and the use of correction terms from economics, limnology, forestry, and hydrology are reviewed and interpreted for application to mammalian allometry. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

The ostrich has a limb structure that appears to be adapted for high speed running with long tendons and short muscle fibres. Here we investigate biomechanics of ostrich gait through growth and, with consideration of anatomical data, identify scaling relationships with increasing body size, relating to forces acting on the musculoskeletal structures, effective mechanical advantage (EMA) and mechanical work. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected through growth from running ostriches. Joint moments scaled in a similar way to the pelvic limb segments as a result of consistent posture through growth, such that EMA was independent of body mass. Since no postural change was observed, relative loads applied to musculoskeletal tissues would be predicted to increase during growth, with greater muscle, and hence tendon, load allowing increased potential for elastic energy storage with increasing size. Mass specific mechanical work per unit distance was independent of body mass, resulting in a small but significant increase in the contribution of elastic energy storage to locomotor economy in larger ostriches.},

  abstract = {The functional anatomy of the pelvic limb of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) was investigated in order to assess musculoskeletal specialization related to locomotor performance. The pelvic limbs of ten ostriches were dissected and detailed measurements of all muscle tendon units of the pelvic limb were made, including muscle mass, muscle length, fascicle length, pennation angle, tendon mass and tendon length. From these measurements other muscle properties such as muscle volume, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), tendon cross-sectional area, maximum isometric muscle force and tendon stress were derived, using standard relationships and published muscle data. Larger muscles tended to be located more proximally and had longer fascicle lengths and lower pennation angles. This led to an expected proximal to distal reduction in total muscle mass. An exception to this trend was the gastrocnemius muscle, which was found to have the largest volume and PCSA and also had the highest capacity for both force and power production. Generally high-power muscles were located more proximally in the limb, while some small distal muscles (tibialis cranialis and flexor perforatus digiti III), with short fibres, were found to have very high force generation capacities. The greatest proportion of pelvic muscle volume was for the hip extensors, while the highest capacity for force generation was observed in the extensors of the ankle, many of which were also in series with long tendons and thus were functionally suited to elastic energy storage.},

Pelvic limbs of six juvenile ostriches were used for this study. The tendon travel technique was used to measure moment arms of 21 muscles at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints throughout the ranges of motion observed during level running. Six of the 21 muscles measured were found to have moment arms that did not change with joint angle, whilst the remainder all demonstrated angle‐dependent changes for at least one of the joints crossed. Moment arm lengths tended to be longest for the large proximal muscles, whilst the largest relative changes were found for the moment arms of the distal muscles. For muscles where moment arm varied with joint angle: all hip muscles were found to have increasing moment arms with extension of the joint, knee flexors were found to have moment arms that increased with extension, knee extensor moment arms were found to increase with flexion and ankle extensor moment arms increased with extension. The greatest relative changes were observed in the flexors of the metatarsophalangeal joint, for which a three‐fold increase in moment arm was observed from flexion to full extension. Changes in muscle moment arm through the range of motion studied appear to optimize muscle function during stance phase, increasing the effective mechanical advantage of these muscles.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Kinematic and kinetic parameters of running gait were investigated through growth in the ostrich, from two weeks up to 10 months of age, in order to investigate the effects of increasing body size. Ontogenetic scaling relationships were compared with published scaling relationships found to exist with increasing body size between species to determine whether dynamic similarity is maintained during growth. During the study, ostrich mass (Mb) ranged from 0.7 kg to 108.8 kg. Morphological measurements showed that lengths scaled with positive allometry during growth (hip height ∝Mb0.40; foot segment length ∝Mb0.40; tarsometatarsus length ∝Mb0.41; tibiotarsus length ∝Mb0.38; femur length ∝Mb0.37), significantly exceeding the close to geometric scaling observed between mammalian and avian species of increasing body size. Scaling of kinematic variables largely agreed with predicted scaling for increasing size and demonstrated relationships close to dynamic similarity and, as such, ontogenetic scaling of locomotor parameters was similar to that observed with increasing body mass between species. However, the ways in which these scaling trends were achieved were very different, with ontogenetic scaling of locomotor mechanics largely resulting from simple scaling of the limb segments rather than postural changes, likely to be due to developmental constraints. Small deviations from dynamic similarity of kinematic parameters and a reduction in the predicted scaling of limb stiffness (∝Mb0.59) were found to be accounted for by the positive allometric scaling of the limb during growth.},

  abstract = {Synopsis               Tyrannosaurid dinosaurs had large preserved leg muscle attachments and low rotational inertia relative to their body mass, indicating that they could turn more quickly than other large theropods.                                         Methods                                To compare turning capability in theropods, we regressed agility estimates against body mass, incorporating superellipse-based modeled mass, centers of mass, and rotational inertia (mass moment of inertia). Muscle force relative to body mass is a direct correlate of agility in humans, and torque gives potential angular acceleration. Agility scores therefore include rotational inertia values divided by proxies for (1) muscle force (ilium area and estimates of m. caudofemoralis longus cross-section), and (2) musculoskeletal torque. Phylogenetic ANCOVA (phylANCOVA) allow assessment of differences in agility between tyrannosaurids and non-tyrannosaurid theropods (accounting for both ontogeny and phylogeny). We applied conditional error probabilities                 a                 (                 p                 ) to stringently test the null hypothesis of equal agility.                                                        Results               Tyrannosaurids consistently have agility index magnitudes twice those of allosauroids and some other theropods of equivalent mass, turning the body with both legs planted or pivoting over a stance leg. PhylANCOVA demonstrates definitively greater agilities in tyrannosaurids, and phylogeny explains nearly all covariance. Mass property results are consistent with those of other studies based on skeletal mounts, and between different figure-based methods (our main mathematical slicing procedures, lofted 3D computer models, and simplified graphical double integration).                                         Implications               The capacity for relatively rapid turns in tyrannosaurids is ecologically intriguing in light of their monopolization of large ({$>$}400 kg), toothed dinosaurian predator niches in their habitats.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modeling human motor control and predicting how humans will move in novel environments is a grand scientific challenge. Researchers in the fields of biomechanics and motor control have proposed and evaluated motor control models via neuromechanical simulations, which produce physically correct motions of a musculoskeletal model. Typically, researchers have developed control models that encode physiologically plausible motor control hypotheses and compared the resulting simulation behaviors to measurable human motion data. While such plausible control models were able to simulate and explain many basic locomotion behaviors (e.g. walking, running, and climbing stairs), modeling higher layer controls (e.g. processing environment cues, planning long-term motion strategies, and coordinating basic motor skills to navigate in dynamic and complex environments) remains a challenge. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning lay a foundation for modeling these complex control processes and controlling a diverse repertoire of human movement; however, reinforcement learning has been rarely applied in neuromechanical simulation to model human control. In this paper, we review the current state of neuromechanical simulations, along with the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, as it applies to human locomotion. We also present a scientific competition and accompanying software platform, which we have organized to accelerate the use of reinforcement learning in neuromechanical simulations. This “Learn to Move” competition was an official competition at the NeurIPS conference from 2017 to 2019 and attracted over 1300 teams from around the world. Top teams adapted state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques and produced motions, such as quick turning and walk-to-stand transitions, that have not been demonstrated before in neuromechanical simulations without utilizing reference motion data. We close with a discussion of future opportunities at the intersection of human movement simulation and reinforcement learning and our plans to extend the Learn to Move competition to further facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration in modeling human motor control for biomechanics and rehabilitation research},

They were connected both with subsarcolemmal caveolae and with T tubules traversing to the A-I junctional level of the preexisting myofibrils.

  abstract = {A popular hypothesis regarding legged locomotion is that humans and other large animals walk and run in a manner that minimizes the metabolic energy expenditure for locomotion. Here, using numerical optimization and supporting analytical arguments, I obtain the energy-minimizing gaits of many different simple biped models. I consider bipeds with point-mass bodies and massless legs, with or without a knee, with or without a springy tendon in series with the leg muscle and minimizing one of many different ‘metabolic cost’ models—correlated with muscle work, muscle force raised to some power, the Minetti–Alexander quasi-steady approximation to empirical muscle metabolic rate (from heat and ATPase activity), a new cost function called the ‘generalized work cost’               C               g               having some positivity and convexity properties (and includes the Minetti–Alexander cost and the work cost as special cases), and generalizations thereof. For many of these models, walking-like gaits are optimal at low speeds and running-like gaits at higher speeds, so a gait transition is optimal. Minimizing the generalized work cost               C               g               appears mostly indistinguishable from minimizing muscle work for all the models. Inverted pendulum walking and impulsive running gaits minimize the work cost, generalized work costs               C               g               and a few other costs for the springless bipeds; in particular, a knee-torque-squared cost, appropriate as a simplified model for electric motor power for a kneed robot biped. Many optimal gaits had symmetry properties; for instance, the left stance phase was identical to the right stance phases. Muscle force–velocity relations and legs with masses have predictable qualitative effects, if any, on the optima. For bipeds with compliant tendons, the muscle work-minimizing strategies have close to zero muscle work (isometric muscles), with the springs performing all the leg work. These zero work gaits also minimize the generalized work costs               C               g               with substantial additive force or force rate costs, indicating that a running animal's metabolic cost could be dominated by the cost of producing isometric force, even though performing muscle work is usually expensive. I also catalogue the many differences between the optimal gaits of the various models. These differences contain information that might help us develop models that better predict locomotion data. In particular, for some biologically plausible cost functions, the presence or absence of springs in series with muscles has a large effect on both the coordination strategy and the absolute cost; the absence of springs results in more impulsive (collisional) optimal gaits and the presence of springs leads to more compliant optimal gaits. Most results are obtained for specific speed and stride length combinations close to preferred human behaviour, but limited numerical experiments show that some qualitative results extend to other speed-stride length combinations as well.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The domestic dog is interesting to investigate because of the wide range of body size, body mass, and physique in the many breeds. In the last several years, the number of clinical and biomechanical studies on dog locomotion has increased. However, the relationship between body structure and joint load during locomotion, as well as between joint load and degenerative diseases of the locomotor system (e.g. dysplasia), are not sufficiently understood. Collecting this data through in vivo measurements/records of joint forces and loads on deep/small muscles is complex, invasive, and sometimes unethical. The use of detailed musculoskeletal models may help fill the knowledge gap. We describe here the methods we used to create a detailed musculoskeletal model with 84 degrees of freedom and 134 muscles. Our model has three key-features: three-dimensionality, scalability, and modularity. We tested the validity of the model by identifying forelimb muscle synergies of a walking Beagle. We used inverse dynamics and static optimization to estimate muscle activations based on experimental data. We identified three muscle synergy groups by using hierarchical clustering. The activation patterns predicted from the model exhibit good agreement with experimental data for most of the forelimb muscles. We expect that our model will speed up the analysis of how body size, physique, agility, and disease influence neuronal control and joint loading in dog locomotion.},

  abstract = {Birds change the shape and area of their wings to an exceptional degree, surpassing insects, bats and aircraft in their ability to morph their wings for a variety of tasks. This morphing is governed by a musculoskeletal system, which couples elbow and wrist motion. Since the discovery of this effect in 1839, the planar ‘drawing parallels’ mechanism has been used to explain the coupling. Remarkably, this mechanism has never been corroborated from quantitative motion data. Therefore, we measured how the wing skeleton of a pigeon (               Columba livia               ) moves during morphing. Despite earlier planar assumptions, we found that the skeletal motion paths are highly three-dimensional and do not lie in the anatomical plane, ruling out the ‘drawing parallels’ mechanism. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography scans in seven consecutive poses show how the two wrist bones contribute to morphing, particularly the sliding ulnare. From these data, we infer the joint types for all six bones that form the wing morphing mechanism and corroborate the most parsimonious mechanism based on least-squares error minimization. Remarkably, the algorithm shows that all optimal four-bar mechanisms either lock, are unable to track the highly three-dimensional bone motion paths, or require the radius and ulna to cross for accuracy, which is anatomically unrealistic. In contrast, the algorithm finds that a six-bar mechanism recreates the measured motion accurately with a parallel radius and ulna and a sliding ulnare. This revises our mechanistic understanding of how birds morph their wings, and offers quantitative inspiration for engineering morphing wings.},

  abstract = {Tyrannosaurid dinosaurs were ecologically unique vertebrates as the sole clade of large terrestrial carnivores (adults {$>$}400 kg) in their continent-spanning habitats. Expanded ligaments between metatarsals, inferred by gross morphology of attachment correlates, have been hypothesized to have strengthened their specialized arctometatarsus. We tested the hypothesis of ligament presence with scanning electron microscopy and histological thin sections of putative attachment sites in a third metatarsal of the tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus libratus, compared with a thin section from the unspecialized metatarsals of the early theropod Coelophysis bauri. In the Gorgosaurus metatarsal, Sharpey´s fibers and rough, pitted surface textures consistent with ligament coalescence occur at expansive distal regions and localized rugosities are ideally located for resisting torsional loading on the foot. Sparser Sharpey’s fibers occur at expected locations in other arctometatarsus-bearing coelurosaurs. In contrast, the Coelophysis metatarsal lacked Sharpey’s fibers or rugosity at the sectioned location, acting as a definitive negative control for identifying these features in tyrannosaurids. With soft-tissue correlates confirmed as ligament entheses, we conclude that tyrannosaurids possessed distinctive and specific ligament attachments to the third metatarsal lacking in other large carnivorous dinosaurs. Histological evidence for extensive distal intermetatarsal ligaments is consistent with greater inferred agility in derived tyrannosaurid dinosaurs than in earlier lineages of large theropods.},

The musculoskeletal model is comprised of segment, joint, muscle-tendon, and ligament information. The dynamic simulation incorporates a proximal forward-driving force, a distal ground reaction force model, muscle activations, and initial positions and velocities. A simulation of the gallop after transection of an accessory ligament demonstrated increased soft tissue strains in the remaining support structures of the distal forelimb. These data were consistent with those previously reported from in vitro experimental data and supported usefulness of the model for the study of distal forelimb soft tissue mechanics during the stance phase of the gallop.},

Since serial sarcomere number correlates with functional excursion in normal muscle, observed changes in sarcomere number are often extrapolated to their new assumed function. However, this has not been well demonstrated experimentally. Thus, we measured the functional properties of muscles stretched due to tendon transfer surgery. Muscle active and passive length-tension curves were measured 1 week and 4 weeks after surgery, and then each muscle was further examined to determine structural adaptation as well as single fiber and fiber bundle passive mechanical properties. We found a disconnect between the functional and structural muscle properties. Specifically, muscle excursion was significantly lower in the transferred muscle compared to controls, even though serial sarcomere number had increased. Furthermore, maximum tetanic tension was significantly reduced, though the two groups had similar physiological cross sectional areas. Passive tension increased in the transferred muscle, which was deemed to be due to proliferation of extracellular matrix. These data are the first to report that muscle morphological adaptation after chronic stretch does not accurately predict the muscle's functional properties. These data have significant implications for examining muscle physiological properties under surgical interventions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study : speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable.             This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores ; four species of primates ; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species):                          where has the units ml O2 s−1 kg−1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s−1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Ėmetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20·1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible :                          where Ėmetab/Mb has the units watts/kg.             This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \& Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this general equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25 \% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.},

This review examines the scaling of hind- and forelimb bones, and the primary ankle extensor muscles and tendons. We find that the scaling of the musculoskeletal system is sensitive to the phylogenetic context. Tibia length increases with positive allometry among most macropodoids, but negative allometry in eastern grey kangaroos and isometry in red kangaroos. Femur length decreases with stronger negative allometry in eastern grey and red kangaroos than among other macropodoids. Muscle masses scale with negative allometry in western grey kangaroos and with isometry in red kangaroos, compared to positive allometry in other macropodoids. We further summarise the work on the hopping gait, energetics in macropodoids, and stresses in the musculoskeletal system in an evolutionary context, to determine what trade-offs may limit locomotor performance in macropodoids. When large kangaroos hop, they do not increase oxygen consumption with speed, unlike most mammals, including small hopping species. We conclude that there is not enough information to isolate the biomechanical factors that make large kangaroos so energy efficient. We identify key areas for further research to fill these gaps.},

  abstract = {Hopping kangaroos exhibit remarkably little change in their rate of metabolic energy expenditure with locomotor speed compared to other running animals. This phenomenon may be related to greater elastic energy savings due to increasing tendon stress; however, the mechanisms which enable the rise in stress remain poorly understood. In this study, we created a three-dimensional (3D) kangaroo musculoskeletal model, integrating 3D motion capture and force plate data, to analyse the kinematics and kinetics of hopping red and grey kangaroos. Using our model, we evaluated how body mass and speed influence (i) hindlimb posture, (ii) effective mechanical advantage (EMA), and (iii) the associated tendon stress in the ankle extensors and (iv) ankle work during hopping. We found that increasing ankle dorsiflexion and metatarsophalangeal plantarflexion likely played an important role in decreasing ankle EMA by altering both the muscle and external moment arms, which subsequently increased energy absorption and peak tendon stress at the ankle. Surprisingly, kangaroo hindlimb posture appeared to contribute to increased tendon stress, thereby elucidating a potential mechanism behind the increase in stress with speed. These posture-mediated increases in elastic energy savings could be a key factor enabling kangaroos to achieve energetic benefits at faster hopping speeds, but may limit the performance of large kangaroos due to the risk of tendon rupture.},

It is not known how differences in matrix organization contribute to distinct mechanical properties in functionally different tendons. We investigated the properties of whole tendons, tendon fascicles and the fascicular interface in the high-strain energy-storing SDFT and low-strain positional CDET. Fascicles failed at lower stresses and strains than tendons. The SDFT was more extensible than the CDET, but SDFT fascicles failed at lower strains than CDET fascicles, resulting in large differences between tendon and fascicle failure strain in the SDFT. At physiological loads, the stiffness at the fascicular interface was lower in the SDFT samples, enabling a greater fascicle sliding that could account for differences in tendon and fascicle failure strain. Sliding between fascicles prior to fascicle extension in the SDFT may allow the large extensions required in energy-storing tendons while protecting fascicles from damage.},

At one of these sites .apprx. 209 m2 of bedding plane was exposed to reveal trackways of {$>$} 150 bipedal dinosaurs. One of these trackways is very much larger than any of the others; it is attributed to a large theropod dinosaur (carnosaur) and is identified as cf. Tyrannosauropus. The remaining trackways are referred to 2 new ichnotaxa WINTONOPUS latomorum and SKARTOPUS australis, which are attributed to ornithopods and coelurosaurs (respectively). The sizes of the track-markers are estimated by means of allometric equations derived from osteological data; the speeds of the track-markers are estimated by using the mathematical relationships of size, speed and gait that have been determined for living tetrapods. The carnosaur is estimated to have been .apprx. 2.6 m high at the hip, and to have been walking at a speed of .apprx. 7 km/h. The ornithopod track-makers ranged from 14-158 cm in height at the hip; these animals were using a fast running gait equivalent to cantering or galloping in mammals, and their mean speed is estimated at 16 km/h. The coelurosaur track-makers ranged from 13 to 22 cm in height at the hip; these too were using a fast running gait, and their mean speed is estimated to have been 12 km/h. The trackways of the ornithopods and coelurosaurs are interpreted as those of animals caught up in a stampede, which was presumably triggered by the approach of the carnosaur. Relative stride length (i.e., stride length relative to height at the hip) is probably the best available criterion for appraising the locomotor performances of dinosaurian track-makers. By this criterion, the performances of the Winton ornithopods and coelurosaurs are outstandingly good. There is an indication that these animals were running at or near their maximum speeds, with relative stride lengths in the range 3.9-5.0.}

Speed estimates are made for 62 dinosaurs (representing 51 genera) and are supplemented with information from comparative anatomy and from dinosaur trackways. It is concluded that smaller bipedal dinosaurs were capable of running at speeds up to 35 or 40 km/h. The so-called "ostrich dinosaurs" are credited with maximum speeds less than 60 km/h, and possibly as low as 35 or 40 km/h. Larger bipedal dinosaurs were probably restricted to walking or slow trotting gaits, with maximum speeds in the range 15-20 km/h. Most quadrupedal dinosaurs seem to have been restricted to a walking gait. Stegosaurs and ankylosaurs may have had maximum speeds as low as 6-8 km/h. Sauropods may have attained 12-17 km/h, and some ceratopsians may have been capable of trotting at speeds up to 25 km/h. On a weight-for-weight basis the speeds of dinosaurs are generally lower than those of mammals. ?? 1982.},

  abstract = {Summary               At least three types of movement take place in the joint complexes of the equine thoracolumbar spine: dorsoventral flexion and extension, axial rotation and lateral bending. Using the standard right‐handed Cartesian coordinate system, these movements may be defined as rotation about the x, y and z axes respectively. Except in cases of intervertebral fusion, all three types of movement occur in each joint complex of the equine back. The greatest amount of dorsoventral movement takes place at the lumbosacral and the first thoracic intervertebral joints. The greatest amount of axial rotation and lateral bending was measured in the mid‐thoracolumbar spine at the level of the 11th or 12th thoracic intervertebral joints. The caudal thoracic and the lumbar spine is the least mobile region of the equine back. In the mid‐thoracic spine, lateral bending was always accompanied by a “coupled” axial rotation. The presence of the rib cage stabilised the cranial thoracic vertebrae against axial rotation.                                         Résumé               Trois types de mouvement au moins se produisent dans les complexes articulaires de la colonne vertébrale thoraco lombaire du cheval; flexion et extension dorso ventrales, rotation axiale et courbure latérale. En utilisant le système coordonné cartésien dextre ces mouvements penvent être définis comme des rotations autour des axes x, y et z. A l'exception des cas de fusion inter vertébrale ces trois types de mouvement se produisent dans chaque complexe articulaire du dos du cheval. Les mouvements dorso ventraux les plus fréquents se produisent dans l'articulation lombo sacrée et dans la première articulation intervertébrale thoracique. Les mouvements de rotation axiale et de courbure latérale les plus nombreux se constatent dans la partie centrale de l'axe thoraco lombaire, 11 ème et 12 ème articulations intervertébrales thoraciques. La partie caudale du segment thoracique et le segment lombaire forment la région la moins mobile du dos du cheval. Dans la partie méso‐thoracique, la courbure latérale est toujours couplée avec une rotation axiale. L'armature costale protège les vertèbres thoraciques craniales d'une rotation axiale.                                         Zusammenfassung               Mindestens drei Bewegungstypen laufen in den Gelenken der thorakolumbalen Wirbelsäule des Pferdes ab: eine dorsoventrale Flexion und Extension, eine axiale Rotation und eine laterale Biegung. Innerhalb des rechtsgerichteten, karthesischen Koordinatensystems können diese Bewegungen als Rotationen um die x, y und z Achse definiert werden. Ausser in Fällen einer intervertebralen Fusion laufen die drei Bewegungstypen in jedem Gelenkskomplex des Pferderückens ab. Das grösste Ausmass nimmt die dorsoventrale Bewegung in den lumbosacralen und in den ersten thorakalen Intervertebralgelenken an. Das grösste Ausmass der axialen Rotation und der lateralen Biegung wurde in der Mitte der thorakolumbalen Wirbelsäule auf der Höhe des 11. und 12. Zwischenwirbelgelenks gemessen. Die hintere thorakale und die lumbäre Wirbelsäule ist am wenigsten beweglich. In der mittleren Brustwirbelsäule war die laterale Biegung immer begleitet von einer “gekuppelten” axialen Rotation. Der Rippenkorb stabilisiert die vordere Brustwirbelsäule gegen die axiale Rotation.},

  abstract = {Unlike most manmade machines, animals move through their world using flexible bodies and appendages, which bend due to internal muscle and body forces, and also due to forces from the environment. Fishes in particular must cope with fluid dynamic forces that not only resist their overall swimming movements but also may have unsteady flow patterns, vortices, and turbulence, many of which occur more rapidly than what the nervous system can process. Has natural selection led to mechanical properties of fish bodies and their component tissues that can respond very quickly to environmental perturbations? Here, we focus on the mechanical properties of isolated muscle tissue and of the entire intact body in the silver lamprey, Ichthyomyzon unicuspis. We developed two modified work loop protocols to determine the effect of small perturbations on the whole body and on isolated segments of muscle as a function of muscle activation and phase within the swimming cycle. First, we examined how the mechanical properties of the whole lamprey body change depending on the timing of muscle activity. Relative to passive muscle, muscle activation can modulate the effective stiffness by about two-fold and modulate the effective damping by {$>$}10-fold depending on the activation phase. Next, we performed a standard work loop test on small sections of axial musculature while adding low-amplitude sinusoidal perturbations at specific frequencies. We modeled the data using a new system identification technique based on time-periodic system analysis and harmonic transfer functions (HTFs) and used the resulting models to predict muscle function under novel conditions. We found that the effective stiffness and damping of muscle varies during the swimming cycle, and that the timing of activation can alter both the magnitude and timing of peak stiffness and damping. Moreover, the response of the isolated muscle was highly nonlinear and length dependent, but the body's response was much more linear. We applied the resulting HTFs from our experiments to explore the effect of pairs of antagonistic muscles. The results suggest that when muscles work against each other as antagonists, the combined system has weaker nonlinearities than either muscle segment alone. Together, these results begin to provide an integrative understanding of how activation timing can tune the mechanical response properties of muscles, enabling fish to swim effectively in their complex and unpredictable environment.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Ever since the origin of tetrapod limbs, the composition and arrangement of skeletal muscles in tetrapod limbs have been largely conserved throughout evolution. There are, however, several exceptions in which new musculoskeletal connections~have been evolutionarily established. The propatagial muscle of birds represents such an example, and there is no comparable muscle in the other tetrapod lineages. Here, we investigate the detailed developmental process of forelimb muscles in the embryos of the chicken and the outgroup taxa. Based on histological and 3D morphological observations in the chicken, the propatagial muscle developed from multiple cell masses derived from parts of the developing               musculus               (               m               .)               deltoideus scapularis               ,               m. pectoralis               ,               m. biceps brachii               , and               m. extensor carpi radialis               , in association with the hypertrophied dermis along the cranial edge of the developing propatagium. We also performed in~situ hybridization of               Scx               and found that there were no tendon progenitor cells along the cranial edge of the propatagium during this process. It is likely that the avian propatagial muscle evolved through recruitment of muscle progenitor cells derived from parts of the               m. deltoideus scapularis               ,               m. pectoralis               ,               m. biceps brachii               , and               m. extensor carpi radialis               , devoid of new interactions with tendon progenitor cells. This study will contribute to a better understanding of how novel musculoskeletal connections can arise from the highly evolutionarily conserved composition and arrangement of skeletal muscles in tetrapod limbs.},

Among the specializations, the propatagium, which accompanies a skeletal muscle spanning between the shoulder and wrist on the leading edge of the wing, represents an evolutionary novelty established at a certain point in the lineage toward crown birds. However, because of the rarity of soft-tissue preservation in the fossil record, the evolutionary origin of the avian propatagium has remained elusive. Here we focus on articulated skeletons in the fossil record to show that angles of elbow joints in fossils are indicators of the propatagium in extant lineages of diapsids (crown birds~and non-dinosaurian diapsids), and then use this relationship to narrow down the phylogenetic position acquiring the propatagium to the common ancestor of maniraptorans. Our analyses support the hypothesis that the preserved propatagium-like soft tissues in non-avian theropod dinosaurs (oviraptorosaurian               Caudipteryx               and dromaeosaurian               Microraptor               ) are homologous with the avian propatagium, and indicate that all maniraptoran dinosaurs likely possessed the propatagium even before the origin of flight. On the other hand, the preserved angles of wrist joints in non-avian theropods are significantly greater than those in birds, suggesting that the avian interlocking wing-folding mechanism involving the ulna and radius had not fully evolved in non-avian theropods. Our study underscores that the avian wing was acquired through modifications of preexisting structures including the feather and propatagium.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Considerable attention has been given to the spring-like behaviour of stretching and recoiling tendons, and how this can reduce the work demanded from muscle for a given loss–return cycling of mechanical energy during high-speed locomotion. However, even completely isometric muscle–tendon units have the potential to act as tension struts, forming links in linkages that avoid the demand for mechanical work-cycling in the first place. Here, forelimb and hindlimb structures and geometries of quadrupeds are considered in terms of linkages that avoid mechanical work at the level of both the whole limb and the individual muscles. The scapula, isometric serratus muscles and forelimb can be viewed as a modified Roberts' straight-line mechanism that supports an approximately horizontal path of the body with vertically orientated forces, resulting in low work demand at the level of both limb and muscle. Modelled isometric triceps brachii inserting to the olecranon form part of a series of four-bar linkages (forelimb) and isometric biceps femoris cranial, rectus femoris and tensor fascia latae form part of a series of six-bar linkages (hindlimb), in both cases potentially resulting in straight-line horizontal motion, generating appropriate moments about shoulder and hip to maintain vertical ground reaction forces and again low mechanical work demand from the limb. Analysing part of the complexity of animal limb structure as linkages that avoid work at the level of both the whole limb and the supporting muscles suggests a new paradigm with which to appreciate the role of isometric muscle–tendon units and multiple muscle origins.},

Can this be attributed to scaling of physical demands and explicit physiological constraints to supply? Here, we describe the scaling of mechanical work demand each stride, and the mechanical power demand each stance. Unlike muscle stress, strain and strain rate, these mechanical demands cannot be circumvented by changing the muscle gearing with minor adaptations in bone geometry or trivial adjustments to limb posture. Constraints to the capacity of muscle to supply work and power impose fundamental limitations to maximum speed. Given an upper limit to muscle work capacity each contraction, maximum speeds in big animals are constrained by the mechanical work demand each step. With an upper limit to instantaneous muscle power production, maximal speeds in small animals are limited by the high power demands during brief stance periods. The high maximum speed of the cheetah may therefore be attributed as much to its size as to its other anatomical and physiological adaptations.},

  abstract = {Subject-specific musculoskeletal modeling can be applied to study musculoskeletal disorders, allowing inclusion of personalized anatomy and properties. Independent of the tools used for model creation, there are unavoidable uncertainties associated with parameter identification, whose effect on model predictions is still not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sensitivity of subject-specific model predictions (i.e., joint angles, joint moments, muscle and joint contact forces) during walking to the uncertainties in the identification of body landmark positions, maximum muscle tension and musculotendon geometry. To this aim, we created an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limbs, defined as a 7-segment, 10-degree-of-freedom articulated linkage, actuated by 84 musculotendon units. We then performed a Monte-Carlo probabilistic analysis perturbing model parameters according to their uncertainty, and solving a typical inverse dynamics and static optimization problem using 500 models that included the different sets of perturbed variable values. Model creation and gait simulations were performed by using freely available software that we developed to standardize the process of model creation, integrate with OpenSim and create probabilistic simulations of movement. The uncertainties in input variables had a moderate effect on model predictions, as muscle and joint contact forces showed maximum standard deviation of 0.3 times body-weight and maximum range of 2.1 times body-weight. In addition, the output variables significantly correlated with few input variables (up to 7 out of 312) across the gait cycle, including the geometry definition of larger muscles and the maximum muscle tension in limited gait portions. Although we found subject-specific models not markedly sensitive to parameter identification, researchers should be aware of the model precision in relation to the intended application. In fact, force predictions could be affected by an uncertainty in the same order of magnitude of its value, although this condition has low probability to occur.}

  abstract = {Background and objective Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations of movement have been increasingly used in orthopedic and neurological scenarios, with increased attention to subject-specific applications. In general, musculoskeletal modeling applications have been facilitated by the development of dedicated software tools; however, subject-specific studies have been limited also by time-consuming modeling workflows and high skilled expertise required. In addition, no reference tools exist to standardize the process of musculoskeletal model creation and make it more efficient. Here we present a freely available software application, NMSBUILDER 2.0, to create musculoskeletal models in the file format of OpenSim, a widely-used open-source platform for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation. NMSBUILDER 2.0 is the result of a major refactoring of a previous implementation that moved a first step toward an efficient workflow for subject-specific model creation. Methods NMSBUILDER includes a graphical user interface that provides access to all functionalities, based on a framework for computer-aided medicine written in C++. The operations implemented can be used in a workflow to create OpenSim musculoskeletal models from 3D surfaces. A first step includes data processing to create supporting objects necessary to create models, e.g. surfaces, anatomical landmarks, reference systems; and a second step includes the creation of OpenSim objects, e.g. bodies, joints, muscles, and the corresponding model. Results We present a case study using NMSBUILDER 2.0: the creation of an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limb. The model included four rigid bodies, five degrees of freedom and 43 musculotendon actuators, and was created from 3D surfaces of the segmented images of a healthy subject through the modeling workflow implemented in the software application. Conclusions We have presented NMSBUILDER 2.0 for the creation of musculoskeletal OpenSim models from image-based data, and made it freely available via nmsbuilder.org. This application provides an efficient workflow for model creation and helps standardize the process. We hope this would help promote personalized applications in musculoskeletal biomechanics, including larger sample size studies, and might also represent a basis for future developments for specific applications.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             Musculoskeletal simulations can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern animal locomotion. In this study, we describe the development of a new musculoskeletal model of the horse, and to our knowledge present the first fully muscle-driven, predictive simulations of equine locomotion. Our goal was to simulate a model that captures only the gross musculoskeletal structure of a horse, without specialized morphological features. We mostly present simulations acquired using feedforward control, without state feedback (“top-down control”). Without using kinematics or motion capture data as an input, we have simulated a variety of gaits that are commonly used by horses (walk, pace, trot, tölt, and collected gallop). We also found a selection of gaits that are not normally seen in horses (half bound, extended gallop, ambling). Due to the clinical relevance of the trot, we performed a tracking simulation that included empirical joint angle deviations in the cost function. To further demonstrate the flexibility of our model, we also present a simulation acquired using spinal feedback control, where muscle control signals are wholly determined by gait kinematics. Despite simplifications to the musculature, simulated footfalls and ground reaction forces followed empirical patterns. In the tracking simulation, kinematics improved with respect to the fully predictive simulations, and muscle activations showed a reasonable correspondence to electromyographic signals, although we did not predict any anticipatory firing of muscles. When sequentially increasing the target speed, our simulations spontaneously predicted walk-to-run transitions at the empirically determined speed. However, predicted stride lengths were too short over nearly the entire speed range unless explicitly prescribed in the controller, and we also did not recover spontaneous transitions to asymmetric gaits such as galloping. Taken together, our model performed adequately when simulating individual gaits, but our simulation workflow was not able to capture all aspects of gait selection. We point out certain aspects of our workflow that may have caused this, including anatomical simplifications and the use of massless Hill-type actuators. Our model is an extensible, generalized horse model, with considerable scope for adding anatomical complexity. This project is intended as a starting point for continual development of the model and code that we make available in extensible open-source formats.},

  abstract = {Locomotor energetics are an important determinant of an animal's ecological niche. It is commonly assumed that animals minimize locomotor energy expenditure by selecting gait kinematics tuned to the natural frequencies of relevant body parts. We demonstrate that this allows estimation of the preferred step frequency and walking speed of Tyrannosaurus rex , using an approach we introduce as the Natural Frequency Method. Although the tail of bipedal dinosaurs was actively involved in walking, it was suspended passively by the caudal interspinous ligaments. These allowed for elastic energy storage, thereby reducing the metabolic cost of transport. In order for elastic energy storage to be high, step and natural frequencies would have to be matched. Using a 3D morphological reconstruction and a spring-suspended biomechanical model, we determined the tail natural frequency of T. rex (0.66 s −1 , range 0.41–0.84), and the corresponding walking speed (1.28 m s −1 , range 0.80–1.64), which we argue to be a good indicator of preferred walking speed (PWS). The walking speeds found here are lower than earlier estimations for large theropods, but agree quite closely with PWS of a diverse group of extant animals. The results are most sensitive to uncertainties regarding ligament moment arms, vertebral kinematics and ligament composition. However, our model formulation and method for estimation of walking speed are unaffected by assumptions regarding muscularity, and therefore offer an independent line of evidence within the field of dinosaur locomotion.}

  abstract = {Background: Powered robotic exoskeletons for assistance of human locomotion are currently under development for military and medical applications. The energy requirements for such devices are excessive, and this has become a major obstacle for practical applications. Legged locomotion in many animals, however, is very energy efficient. We propose that poly-articular elastic mechanisms are a major contributor to the economy of locomotion in such specialized animals. Consequently, it should be possible to design unpowered assistive devices that make effective use of similar mechanisms. Methods: A passive assistive technology is presented, based on long elastic cords attached to an exoskeleton and guided by pulleys placed at the joints. A general optimization procedure is described for finding the best geometrical arrangement of such "exotendons" for assisting a specific movement. Optimality is defined either as minimal residual joint moment or as minimal residual joint power. Four specific exotendon systems with increasing complexity are considered. Representative human gait data were used to optimize each of these four systems to achieve maximal assistance for normal walking. Results: The most complex exotendon system, with twelve pulleys per limb, was able to reduce the joint moments required for normal walking by 71\% and joint power by 74\%. A simpler system, with only three pulleys per limb, could reduce joint moments by 46\% and joint power by 47\%. Conclusion: It is concluded that unpowered passive elastic devices can substantially reduce the muscle forces and the metabolic energy needed for walking, without requiring a change in movement. When optimally designed, such devices may allow independent locomotion in patients with large deficits in muscle function. ©2003 van de Bogert; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

A model of the forelimb was used to determine force distributions in the digital flexor tendons, and to experiment with various methods to change the force distribution.

  abstract = {Rowers need to combine high sprint and endurance capacities. Muscle morphology largely explains muscle power generating capacity, however, little is known on how muscle morphology relates to rowing performance measures. The aim was to determine how muscle morphology of the vastus lateralis relates to rowing ergometer performance, sprint and endurance capacity of Olympic rowers. Eighteen rowers (12♂, 6♀, who competed at 2016 Olympics) performed an incremental rowing test to obtain maximal oxygen consumption, reflecting endurance capacity. Sprint capacity was assessed by Wingate cycling peak power. M. vastus lateralis morphology (volume, physiological cross-sectional area, fascicle length and pennation angle) was derived from 3-dimensional ultrasound imaging. Thirteen rowers (7♂, 6♀) completed a 2000-m rowing ergometer time trial. Muscle volume largely explained variance in 2000-m rowing performance (R2 = 0.85), maximal oxygen consumption (R2 = 0.65), and Wingate peak power (R2 = 0.82). When normalized for differences in body size, maximal oxygen consumption and Wingate peak power were negatively related in males (r = −0.94). Fascicle length, not physiological cross-sectional area, attributed to normalized peak power. In conclusion, vastus lateralis volume largely explains variance in rowing ergometer performance, sprint and endurance capacity. For a high normalized sprint capacity, athletes may benefit from long fascicles rather than a large physiological cross-sectional area.},

  abstract = {In modelling and understanding the contact and friction behaviour of human skin, the elastic modulus of the skin is an important input parameter. For the development of design rules for the engineering of surfaces in contact with the skin an expression that describes the relation between the elastic modulus of the skin and the size of the contact is essential.             Although an exact description of the mechanical behaviour of the skin requires an anisotropic, nonlinear, viscoelastic model, in this study it was found that for contact modelling involving relatively small deformations, the mechanical behaviour seems to be accurately described by a single parameter: the effective elastic modulus. The effective elastic modulus is shown to decrease several orders of magnitude when the length scale increases, which is the consequence of the rather complex anatomy of the skin. At an indentation depth of 10\,µm, the effective elastic modulus was shown to decrease from 0.15 to 0.015\,MPa when the radius of curvature of the indenter increases from 10\,µm to 10\,mm. The variation of the elasticity is explained by the variation in the composition and properties of the different skin layers. This study shows that for the contact modelling of human skin, a closed-form expression based on the anatomy of the skin exists, which yields the magnitude of the effective elastic modulus of the skin as a function of the length scale of the contact depending on variables such as age, gender and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a planar architectural model for an activated skeletal muscle, with mechanical equilibrium throughout the muscle belly. The model can predict the shape of the muscle fibres and tendinous sheets as well as the internal pressure distribution in the central longitudinal plane (perpendicular to the tendinous sheets) of uni- and bipennate muscle bellies. Mechanically stable solutions for muscle architectures were calculated by equating the pressure developed by curved muscle fibres with the pressure under a curved tendinous sheet. The pressure distribution under a tendinous sheet is determined by its tension, its curvature and the tensile stress of the attached muscle fibres. Dissections showed a good resemblance of the architecture of embalmed muscles with those from our simulations. Calculated maximum pressures are in the same order of magnitude as pressure measurements from the literature. Our model predicts that intramuscular blood flow can be blocked during sustained contraction, as several experimental studies have indeed demonstrated. The volume fractions of muscle fibres and interfibre space in the muscle belly were also calculated. The planar models predict a too low volume fraction for the muscle fibres (about 45\% for the bipennate models with a straight central aponeurosis, and about 60\% for the simulated unipennate muscle). It is discussed how, in a real muscle, this volume problem can be solved by a special three-dimensional arrangement of muscle fibres in combination with varying widths of the tendinous sheets.},

  abstract = {Several of the models proposed in the literature of unipennate muscles, which have two tendinous sheets and in-line tendons, cannot meet the criterion of mechanical stability. Based on the theory of Van Leeuwen \& Spoor (               Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.               B 336, 275-292 (1992)), we discuss how mechanically stable solutions for (planar) unipennate architectures could be obtained. A mathematical model is proposed in which the muscle architecture is generated numerically using the principles of mechanical stability and assuming that all muscle fibres shorten by the same relative amount. The tendinous sheets are attached tangentially to their respective tendons, as predicted from their low bending stiffness. The curvature, however, is discontinuous at the junction because of the sudden absence of muscle fibres from aponeurosis to tendon. In two of the muscle shapes generated, the sheets adjacent to the tendon show a region of negative curvature connected to a region of positive curvature. A sheet with a concave outer side is defined to have a negative curvature. In another example, two negative curvature regions are present with a positive region in-between. We show also a generated shape with a negative curvature of the sheets over their whole length. A good resemblance was found between the unipennate medial gastrocnemius muscle of the cat and a simulated architecture. The pressure distribution has also been calculated. With all muscle fibres exerting the same tensile stress of 200 kPa, a high pressure region is present in the centre of the muscle belly, half-way along its length. The highest pressures are predicted for muscles with long tendinous sheets, large attachment angles, and strongly curved fibres. Maximum pressures (2.40, 9.54, 10.47, and 7.57 kPa for the four discussed examples, and 15.05 kPa for the simulated gastrocnemius muscle) were at the lower side of the range as predicted previously for bipennate muscles and the unipennate medial gastrocnemius muscle of man (Van Leeuwen \& Spoor 1992).},

  abstract = {Squid use eight arms and two slender tentacles to capture prey. The muscular stalks of the tentacles are elongated approximately 80\% in 20–40~ms towards the prey, which is adhered to the terminal clubs by arrays of suckers. Using a previously developed forward dynamics model of the extension of the tentacles of the squid               Doryteuthis pealeii               (formerly               Loligo pealeii               ), we predict how spatial muscle-activation patterns result in a distribution of muscular power, muscle work, and kinetic and elastic energy along the tentacle. The simulated peak extension speed of the tentacles is remarkably insensitive to delays of activation along the stalk, as well as to random variations in the activation onset. A delay along the tentacle of 50\% of the extension time has only a small effect on the peak extension velocity of the tentacle compared with a zero-delay pattern. A slight delay of the distal portion relative to the proximal has a small positive effect on peak extension velocity, whereas negative delays (delay reversed along stalk) always reduce extension performance. In addition, tentacular extension is relatively insensitive to superimposed random variations in the prescribed delays along the stalk. This holds in particular for small positive delays that are similar to delays predicted from measured axonal diameters of motor neurons. This robustness against variation in the activation distribution reduces the accuracy requirements of the neuronal control and is likely due to the non-linear mechanical properties of the muscular tissue in the tentacle.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Parasitic wasps use specialized needle‐like structures, ovipositors, to drill into substrates to reach hidden hosts. The external ovipositor (terebra) consists of three interconnected, sliding elements (valvulae), which are moved reciprocally during insertion. This presumably reduces the required pushing force on the terebra and limits the risk of damage whilst probing. Although this is an important mechanism, it is still not completely understood how the actuation of the valvulae is achieved, and it has only been studied with the ovipositor in rest position. Additionally, very little is known about the magnitude of the forces generated during probing. We used synchrotron X‐ray microtomography to reconstruct the actuation mechanism of the parasitic wasp               Diachasmimorpha longicaudata               (Braconidae) in four distinct phases of the probing cycle. We show that only the paired first valvulae of the terebra move independently, while the second valvula moves with the metasoma (‘abdomen’). The first valvula movements are initiated by rotation of one chitin plate (first valvifer) with respect to another such plate (second valvifer). This is achieved indirectly by muscles connecting the non‐rotating second valvifer and the abdominal ninth tergite. Contrary to previous reports, we found muscle fibres running inside the terebra, although their function remains unclear. The estimated maximal forces that can be exerted by the first valvulae are small (protraction 1.19~mN and retraction 0.874~mN), which reduces the risk of buckling, but are sufficient for successful probing. The small net forces of the valvulae on the substrate may still lead to buckling of the terebra; we show that the sheaths surrounding the valvulae prevent this by effectively increasing the diameter and second moment of area of the terebra. Our findings improve the comprehension of hymenopteran probing mechanisms, the function of the associated muscles, and the forces and damage‐limiting mechanism that are involved in drilling a slender terebra into a substrate.},

During this take‐off, she has to carry a large payload, up to three times her body weight, while avoiding tactile detection by the host. What separates the malaria mosquito from most other insects is that the mosquito pushes off gently with its legs while producing aerodynamic forces with its wings. Apart from generating the required forces, the malaria mosquito has to produce the correct torques to pitch‐up during take‐off. Furthermore, the fed mosquito has to alter the direction of its aerodynamic force vector to compensate for the higher body pitch angle due to its heavier abdomen. Whether the mosquito generates these torques and redirection of the forces with its wings or legs remains unknown. By combining rigid‐body inverse dynamics analyses with computational fluid dynamics simulations, we show that mosquitoes use leg push‐off to control pitch torques and that the adaption of the aerodynamic force direction is synchronized with modulations in force magnitude. These results suggest that during the push‐off phase of a take‐off, mosquitoes use their flight apparatus primarily as a motor system and they use leg push‐off forces for control.                        ,              Research highlights                                                                Malaria mosquitoes use their legs to control the rapid pitch‐up maneuver at the start of a take‐off, whereas the wings are primarily used as a motor system.

  abstract = {SUMMARY             When gibbons travel through the forest canopy, brachiation is alternated with short bipedal bouts over horizontal boughs. We know, from previous research, that brachiation is a very efficient locomotor mode that makes use of a pendulum-like exchange of energy, but to date, nothing is known about the dynamics of hylobatid bipedalism. We wondered if gibbons also make use of an efficient gait mechanism during bipedal locomotion. To investigate this, we calculated oscillations of the centre of mass (COM), energy fluctuations,recovery rates and power outputs from the 3D ground reaction forces. These ground reaction forces were collected during spontaneous bipedal locomotion of four untrained white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) over an instrumented walkway (with an AMTI force plate). Excursions of the COM are relatively large during hylobatid bipedalism and the fluctuations of potential and kinetic energy are largely in-phase. Together with the low inverted pendulum recovery rates, this points to a spring-mass mechanism during bipedal locomotion. Although the well-developed Achilles tendon of gibbons seems to be a good candidate for the storage and recoil of elastic energy, this is not supported by kinematical data of the ankle joint. Instead, we suggest that the knee extensor muscle tendon unit functions as an energy-saving mechanism during hylobatid bipedalism, but detailed anatomical data is needed to confirm this suggestion. At low speeds gibbons use either pendular or spring mechanics, but a clear gait transition as seen in most quadrupedal mammals is absent. At moderate to high velocities, gibbons use a bouncing gait, generally without aerial phases. This supports the view that aerial phases are not a prerequisite for spring-mass mechanics and reinforces the claim that duty factor alone should not be used to distinguish between a walk and run.},

Gibbons and bonobos are both highly arboreal species, yet they have a different locomotor behaviour. Gibbon locomotion is almost exclusively arboreal and is characterized by speed and mobility, whereas bonobo locomotion entails some terrestrial knuckle‐walking and both mobility and stability are important. We examine if these differences in locomotion are reflected in their foot myology. Therefore, we have executed detailed dissections of the lower hind limb of two bonobo and three gibbon cadavers. We took several measurements on the isolated muscles (mass, length, physiological cross sectional area, etc.) and calculated the relative muscle masses and belly lengths of the major muscle groups to make interspecific comparisons. An extensive description of all foot and ankle muscles is given and differences between gibbons, bonobos and humans are discussed. No major differences were found between the foot and ankle musculature of both apes; however, marked differences were found between the ape and human foot. The human foot is specialized for solely one type of locomotion, whereas ape feet are extremely adaptable to a wide variety of locomotor modes. Apart from providing interesting anatomical data, this study can also be helpful for the interpretation of fossil (pre)hominids.},

  abstract = {Sauropods were among the most diverse lineages of dinosaurs, with an ample geographic distribution throughout the Mesozoic. This evolutionary success is largely attributed to neck elongation and its impact on feeding efficiency. However, how neck elongation influenced exactly on feeding strategies is subject of debate. The process of mounting a nearly complete virtual skeleton of Spinophorosaurus nigerensis, from the Middle (?) Jurassic of Niger, has revealed several previously unknown osteological adaptations in this taxon. Wedged sacral and posterior dorsal vertebrae cause the presacral column to deflect antero-dorsally. This, together with elongated scapulae and humeri make the anterior region of the skeleton vertically lengthened. Also, elongated prezygapophyseal facets on the cervical vertebrae and a specialized first dorsal vertebra greatly increase the vertical range of motion of the neck. These characters support this early eusauropod as a more capable high browser than more basally branching sauropods. While limb proportions and zygapophyseal facets vary among Eusauropoda, the sacrum retained more than 10° of wedging in all Eusauropoda. This implied a functional constraint for sauropod species which evolved lower browsing feeding strategies: the antero-dorsal sloping caused by the sacrum had to be counteracted with further skeletal modifications, e.g. a ventrally curved mid to anterior presacral spine to hinder the dorsal slope of the whole presacral series caused by the wedged sacrum. This suggests that at least the last common ancestor of Eusauropoda developed high browsing capabilities, partially due to the modified wedged sacrum, likely a potential synapomorphy of the clade and key in the evolutionary history of the group.}

  abstract = {Background: The nucleus pulposus is extremely deformable and it is not uncommon to observe strain amplitudes as large as 12.5\% in physiological loading conditions. It has been shown that the nucleus pulposus contributes to the damping properties of the intervertebral disc. The quantification of the damping properties of the nucleus pulposus under physiological large deformations is then a key aspect for its mechanical characterization and for the design of nucleus replacement devices. Methods: A specific mechanical device has been developed to encapsulate nucleus pulposus tissues into a deformable and permeable device, while quantifying its water content. The specific damping capacity was defined by dividing the energy loss by the work input. With this device and definition, the specific damping capacity of the bovine coccygeal nucleus pulposus was quantified in large compressive deformations (12.5\%) and for frequencies ranging between 10- 2 and 101 Hz. Findings: It is found that the specific damping capacity of the nucleus pulposus of the bovine coccygeal ranged between 18 and 36\%. The lowest values of specific damping capacity are found for frequencies corresponding to the dynamics of loads in all day activities such as walking (0.1 to 1 Hz). Interpretation: The nucleus pulposus contributes to dissipate energy under physiological large deformations. However, it seems that the nucleus pulposus is designed so that damping is minimal for frequencies corresponding to moderate daily activities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The aim of the current review is to discuss applications and mechanism of eccentric exercise in training regimes of competitive sports. Eccentric muscle work is important in most sports. Eccentric muscle contractions enhance the performance during the concentric phase of stretch-shortening cycles, which is important in disciplines like sprinting, jumping, throwing, and running. Muscles activated during lengthening movements can also function as shock absorbers, to decelerate during landing tasks or to precisely deal with high external loading in sports like alpine skiing. The few studies available on trained subjects reveal that eccentric training can further enhance maximal muscle strength and power. It can further optimize muscle length for maximal tension development at a greater degree of extension, and has potential to improve muscle coordination during eccentric tasks. In skeletal muscles, these functional adaptations are based on increases in muscle mass, fascicle length, number of sarcomeres, and cross-sectional area of type II fibers. Identified modalities for eccentric loading in athletic populations involve classical isotonic exercises, accentuated jumping exercises, eccentric overloading exercises, and eccentric cycle ergometry. We conclude that eccentric exercise offers a promising training modality to enhance performance and to prevent injuries in athletes. However, further research is necessary to better understand how the neuromuscular system adapts to eccentric loading in athletes.},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted to the permanence of the concept of Zero-Moment Point, widely-known by the acronym ZMP. Thirty-five years have elapsed since its implicit presentation (actually before being named ZMP) to the scientific community and thirty-three years since it was explicitly introduced and clearly elaborated, initially in the leading journals published in English. Its first practical demonstration took place in Japan in 1984, at Waseda University, Laboratory of Ichiro Kato, in the first dynamically balanced robot WL-10RD of the robotic family WABOT. The paper gives an in-depth discussion of source results concerning ZMP, paying particular attention to some delicate issues that may lead to confusion if this method is applied in a mechanistic manner onto irregular cases of artificial gait, i.e. in the case of loss of dynamic balance of a humanoid robot.             After a short survey of the history of the origin of ZMP a very detailed elaboration of ZMP notion is given, with a special review concerning "boundary cases" when the ZMP is close to the edge of the support polygon and "fictious cases" when the ZMP should be outside the support polygon. In addition, the difference between ZMP and the center of pressure is pointed out. Finally, some unresolved or insufficiently treated phenomena that may yield a significant improvement in robot performance are considered.},

  abstract = {The present study is aimed at investigating changes in the coordination of arm and leg movements in young healthy subjects. It was hypothesized that with changes in walking velocity there is a change in frequency and phase coupling between the arms and the legs. In addition, it was hypothesized that the preferred frequencies of the different coordination patterns can be predicted on the basis of the resonant frequencies of arms and legs with a simple pendulum model. The kinematics of arms and legs during treadmill walking in seven healthy subjects were recorded with accelerometers in the sagittal plane at a wide range of different velocities (i.e., 0.3-1.3m/s). Power spectral analyses revealed a statistically significant change in the frequency relation between arms and legs, i.e., within the velocity range 0.3-0.7m/s arm movement frequencies were dominantly synchronized with the step frequency, whereas from 0.8m/s onwards arm frequencies were locked onto stride frequency. Significant effects of walking speed on mean relative phase between leg and arm movements were found. All limb pairs showed a significantly more stable coordination pattern from 0.8 to 1.0m/s onwards. Results from the pendulum modelling demonstrated that for most subjects at low-velocity preferred movement frequencies of the arms are predicted by the resonant frequencies of individual arms (about 0.98Hz), whereas at higher velocities these are predicted on the basis of the resonant frequencies of the individual legs (about 0.85Hz). The results support the above-mentioned hypotheses, and suggest that different patterns of coordination, as shown by changes in frequency coupling and phase relations, can exist within the human walking mode.

ANIMALS               12 orthopedically normal Icelandic horses.                                         PROCEDURES               Kinetic and kinematic gait variables were simultaneously recorded as each horse was ridden at a tölt and trot on an instrumented treadmill at 3.4 m/s and 3.9 m/s. Differences between gaits were tested via 1-factor repeated-measures ANOVA.                                         RESULTS               Horses had a higher stride rate and lower stride impulses at a tölt than at a trot. For forelimbs at a tölt, shorter relative stance duration resulted in higher peak vertical force (Fz               peak               ). Conversely, for hind limbs, longer relative stance duration resulted in lower Fz               peak               . The higher head-neck position at a tölt versus trot caused no weight shift to the hind limbs, but a higher forehoof flight arc and lower proretraction movement were identified. Stance durations for forelimbs were briefer than for hind limbs at a tölt, and the inverse was observed at a trot. Minimal height of the horse's trunk at the point of Fz               peak               of the respective limb suggested a spring-like mechanism for all limbs at a tölt. Hind limb measurements revealed no evidence of increased collection. Stride-to-stride limb timing varied more at a tölt than at a trot. At a trot, horses had brief or no suspension phases and a slightly 4-beated footfall rhythm was common. Post hoc energetic estimations revealed that tölting at the measured speeds was less advantageous than trotting.                                         CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE               High forelimb action in Icelandic horses and higher head-neck position at a tölt were associated with more restricted limb proretraction, higher Fz               peak               , and faster force onset than at a trot. The impact of these differences on orthopedic health needs to be investigated more in detail.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            The energetic cost of walking varies with mass and speed; however, the metabolic cost of carrying loads has not consistently increased proportionally to the mass carried. The cost of carrying mass, and the speed at which human walkers carry this mass, has been shown to vary with load position and load description (e.g. child vs. groceries). Additionally, the preponderance of women carriers around the world, and the tendency for certain kinds of population-level sexual dimorphism has led to the hypothesis that women might be more effective carriers than men. Here, I investigate the energetic cost and speed changes of women (               N =               9) and men (               N =               6) walking through the woods carrying their own babies (mean baby mass = 10.6 kg) in three different positions – on their front, side and back using the same Ergo fabric baby sling. People carrying their babies on their backs are able to maintain their unloaded walking speed (1.4 m/s) and show the lowest increase in metabolic cost per distance (J/m, 17.4\%). Women carry the babies for a lower energetic cost than men at all conditions (               p               {$<$} 0.01). Further energetic and kinematic evidence elucidates the preponderance of back-carrying cross-culturally, and illustrates the importance of relatively wider bi-trochanteric breadths for reducing the energetic costs of carrying.},

Most aquatic mammals studied exhibited significantly higher limb-bone density than did the terrestrial mammals. It is proposed that the higher bone density of aquatic mammals is an adaptation to reduce problems of buoyancy. Cetaceans and some "pinnipeds" have secondarily reduced bone density with the acquisition of lung collapse during deep dives. The greater bone density of aquatic mammals is at least partially achieved through increased deposition of compact bone along the shafts of limb bones. As a result it is possible to differentiate visually aquatic from terrestrial limb elements by sectioning the bone and examining the percentage of compact bone present. Fossil bones can be interpreted in the same manner, thus providing a quantifiable test for the determination of life habits in extinct mammals.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle expresses high levels of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), predominantly at myotendinous junctions (MTJs) and costameres. ILK binds the cytoplasmic domain of beta1 integrin and mediates phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, which in turn plays a central role during skeletal muscle regeneration. We show that mice with a skeletal muscle-restricted deletion of ILK develop a mild progressive muscular dystrophy mainly restricted to the MTJs with detachment of basement membranes and accumulation of extracellular matrix. Endurance exercise training enhances the defects at MTJs, leads to disturbed subsarcolemmal myofiber architecture, and abrogates phosphorylation of Ser473 as well as phosphorylation of Thr308 of PKB/Akt. The reduction in PKB/Akt activation is accompanied by an impaired insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) activation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that the beta1 integrin subunit is associated with the IGF-1R in muscle cells. Our data identify the beta1 integrin-ILK complex as an important component of IGF-1R/insulin receptor substrate signaling to PKB/Akt during mechanical stress in skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             Despite longstanding interest in convergent evolution, factors that result in deviations from fully convergent phenotypes remain poorly understood. In birds, the evolution of flightless wing-propelled diving has emerged as a classic example of convergence, having arisen in disparate lineages including penguins (Sphenisciformes) and auks (Pan-Alcidae, Charadriiformes). Nevertheless, little is known about the functional anatomy of the wings of flightless auks because all such taxa are extinct, and their morphology is almost exclusively represented by skeletal remains. Here, in order to re-evaluate the extent of evolutionary convergence among flightless wing-propelled divers, wing muscles and ligaments were reconstructed in two extinct flightless auks, representing independent transitions to flightlessness: Pinguinus impennis (a crown-group alcid), and Mancalla (a stem-group alcid). Extensive anatomical data were gathered from dissections of 12 species of extant charadriiforms and 4 aequornithine waterbirds including a penguin. The results suggest that the wings of both flightless auk taxa were characterized by an increased mechanical advantage of wing elevator/retractor muscles, and decreased mobility of distal wing joints, both of which are likely advantageous for wing-propelled diving and parallel similar functional specializations in penguins. However, the conformations of individual muscles and ligaments underlying these specializations differ markedly between penguins and flightless auks, instead resembling those in each respective group’s close relatives. Thus, the wings of these flightless wing-propelled divers can be described as convergent as overall functional units, but are incompletely convergent at lower levels of anatomical organization—a result of retaining differing conditions from each group’s respective volant ancestors. Detailed investigations such as this one may indicate that, even in the face of similar functional demands, courses of phenotypic evolution are dictated to an important degree by ancestral starting points.},

  abstract = {A widely held assumption is that metabolic rate ( Ė met ) during legged locomotion is linked to the mechanics of different gaits and this linkage helps explain the preferred speeds of animals in nature. However, despite several prominent exceptions, Ė met of walking and running vertebrates has been nearly uniformly characterized as increasing linearly with speed across all gaits. This description of locomotor energetics does not predict energetically optimal speeds for minimal cost of transport ( E cot ). We tested whether large bipedal ratite birds (emus and ostriches) have gait-specific energetics during walking and running similar to those found in humans. We found that during locomotion, emus showed a curvilinear relationship between Ė met and speed during walking, and both emus and ostriches demonstrated an abrupt change in the slope of Ė met versus speed at the gait transition with a linear increase during running. Similar to human locomotion, the minimum net E cot calculated after subtracting resting metabolism was lower in walking than in running in both species. However, the difference in net E cot between walking and running was less than is found in humans because of a greater change in the slope of Ė met versus speed at the gait transition, which lowers the cost of running for the avian bipeds. For emus, we also show that animals moving freely overground avoid a range of speeds surrounding the gait-transition speed within which the E cot is large. These data suggest that deviations from a linear relation of metabolic rate and speed and variations in transport costs with speed are more widespread than is often assumed, and provide new evidence that locomotor energetics influences the choice of speed in bipedal animals. The low cost of transport for walking is probably ecologically important for emus and ostriches because they spend the majority of their active day walking, and thus the energy used for locomotion is a large part of their daily energy budget.},

  abstract = {Multi-body dynamics is a powerful engineering tool which is becoming increasingly popular for the simulation and analysis of skull biomechanics. This paper presents the first application of multi-body dynamics to analyse the biomechanics of the rabbit skull. A model has been constructed through the combination of manual dissection and three-dimensional imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging and micro-computed tomography). Individual muscles are represented with multiple layers, thus more accurately modelling muscle fibres with complex lines of action. Model validity was sought through comparing experimentally measured maximum incisor bite forces with those predicted by the model. Simulations of molar biting highlighted the ability of the masticatory system to alter recruitment of two muscle groups, in order to generate shearing or crushing movements. Molar shearing is capable of processing a food bolus in all three orthogonal directions, whereas molar crushing and incisor biting are predominately directed vertically. Simulations also show that the masticatory system is adapted to process foods through several cycles with low muscle activations, presumably in order to prevent rapidly fatiguing fast fibres during repeated chewing cycles. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of a validated multi-body dynamics model for investigating feeding biomechanics in the rabbit, and shows the potential for complementing and eventually reducing               in vivo               experiments.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Three muscles from the proximal equine forelimb were dissected in order to investigate their potential to contribute to proximal limb mechanics. Muscle mass, fibre length, tendon mass and tendon length were measured from biceps brachii, triceps brachii, supraspinatus and lacertus fibrosus (biceps lateral head mass 171–343.4~g and fibre length 0.5–0.8~cm; biceps medial head mass 283–500~g and fibre length 2.2–4~cm; biceps tendon mass 121.8–260~g and tendon length 35–44~cm; triceps long head mass 3200–6663~g and fibre length 19–26.3~cm; triceps lateral head mass 513.8–1240~g and fibre length 17.5–24~cm; triceps medial head mass 85.2–270.6~g and fibre length 9–16.8~cm; supraspinatus mass 793–1546~g and fibre length 4.7–12.4~cm; lacertus fibrosus mass 4.6–12.4~g and length 10–16~cm). Physiological cross‐sectional area (PCSA) and maximum isometric force were estimated for each muscle, and moment arm measurements were taken at the shoulder and elbow joints. Biceps has a greater isometric force‐generating capacity than supraspinatus. It also appears to have a larger shoulder moment arm, so could therefore have the potential to make a greater contribution to the shoulder moment than supraspinatus. Supraspinatus is likely to function primarily as a shoulder stabilizer rather than a shoulder extensor. Biceps also functions as an elbow flexor and data here indicate that it has a greater PCSA and isometric force‐generating capacity than its antagonist triceps brachii. Calculation of tendon forces showed that the biceps tendon can withstand much greater forces than lacertus fibrosus. This study will enable further investigation into the interaction between energy recycling in elastic tissues and the generation and absorption of mechanical work by adjacent muscle groups in the equine forelimb.},

Ultrasound (US) imaging allows quantification of muscle size, fascicle length, and angle of pennation. These morphological variables are important determinants of muscle force and length range of force exertion. The presented protocol describes an approach to determine volume and fascicle length of m. vastus lateralis and m. gastrocnemius medialis. 3DUS facilitates standardization using 3D anatomical references. This approach provides a fast and cost-effective approach for quantifying 3D morphology in skeletal muscles. In healthcare and sports, information on the morphometry of muscles is very valuable in diagnostics and/or follow-up evaluations after treatment or training.},

  abstract = {Summary                            Reasons for performing study:               Gait analysis parameters are sensitive to alterations in velocity. For comparison of nonspeed‐matched data, the velocity dependency needs to be known.                                         Objectives:               To describe the changes in gait pattern and determine the relationships between stride duration, vertical impulse, contact time and peak vertical force within a range of walking and trotting speeds.                                         Methods:               Thirty‐eight nonlame Warmblood horses were subjected to an incremental speed test. The spans of speed were adjusted individually to each horse and ranged from 1.1–2.1{$\quad$}m/s at walk and from 2.5–5.8{$\quad$}m/s at trot. Time, force and spatial parameters of each limb were measured with an instrumented treadmill and analysed with regression analysis using velocity as the independent variable.                                         Results:               At a slow walk the shape of the force curve was generally single‐peaked in the fore‐ and trapezoidal in the hindlimbs. With increasing speed, the curves turned into the typical double‐peaked shape with a higher second peak in the fore‐ and a higher first peak in the hindlimbs. With increasing velocity, stride duration, stance durations and limb impulses of the fore‐ and hindlimbs decreased in both gaits (r               2               {$>$}0.92). Increasing speed caused a weight shift to the forehand (walk: from 56 to 59\%; trot: from 55 to 57\%). Despite decreasing limb impulses, peak vertical forces increased in both gaits (r                                2                              {$>$}0.83). The suspension duration of the trot increased with faster velocities and reached a plateau of around 90{$\quad$}ms at the highest speeds. At a slow trot, the forelimbs impacted first and followed the hindlimbs at lift‐off; with increasing speed, the horses tended to impact earlier with the hindlimbs. Contralateral symmetry indices of all parameters remained unchanged.                                         Conclusions:               Subject velocity affects time, force and spatial parameters. Knowing the mathematical function of these interdependencies enables correction of nonspeed‐matched data.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study are to examine the fundamental characteristics of the biodynamic responses of a rat tail to vibration and to compare them with those of human fingers. Vibration transmission through tails exposed to three vibration magnitudes (1 g, 5 g, and 10 g r.m.s.) at six frequencies (32 Hz, 63 Hz, 125 Hz, 160 Hz, 250 Hz, and 500 Hz) was measured using a laser vibrometer. A mechanical-equivalent model of the tail was established on the basis of the transmissibility data, which was used to estimate the biodynamic deformation and vibration power absorption at several representative locations on the tail. They were compared with those derived from a mechanical-equivalent model of human fingers reported in the literature. This study found that, similar to human fingers, the biodynamic responses of the rat tail depends on the vibration magnitude, frequency, and measurement location. With the restraint method used in this study, the natural frequency of the rat tail is in the range 161-368 Hz, which is mostly within the general range of human finger resonant frequencies (100-350 Hz). However, the damping ratios of the rat tail at the unconstrained locations are from 0.094 to 0.394, which are lower than those of human fingers (0.708-0.725). Whereas the biodynamic responses of human fingers at frequencies lower than 100 Hz could be significantly influenced by the biodynamics of the entire hand-arm system, the rat tail biodynamic responses can be considered independent of the rat body in the frequency range used in this study. Based on these findings it is concluded that, although there are some differences between the frequency dependences of the biodynamic responses of the rat tail and human fingers, the rat tail model can provide a practical and reasonable approach to examine the relationships between the biodynamic and biological responses at midrange to high frequencies, and to understand the mechanisms underlying vibration-induced finger disorders.},

Fortunately, the theropod pes shares a close morphology with extant large cursorial birds. Therefore, to better understand the pedal range of motion of               Australovenator               , the pedal range of motion of               Dromaius novaehollandiae               (commonly known as the emu) was analysed with and without soft tissue.

Computed tomography scans of               Dromaius               pes in fully flexed and fully extended positions provided the soft tissue range of motion limits. The bone on bone range of motion of the same specimen was replicated following the removal of soft tissue. It was identified that there was an increase in range of motion potential with the removal of soft tissue. This variation provided a guide to develop the potential range of motion of a fully fleshed               Australovenator               pes. Additionally, the dissection of the               Dromaius               pes provided a guide enabling the replication of the corresponding soft tissue and keratin sheaths of the               Australovenator               pes.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Two studies have focused on potential triggers for the trot–gallop transition in the horse. One study concluded that the transition was triggered by metabolic economy. The second study found that it was not metabolic factors but, rather, peak musculoskeletal forces that determine gait transition speeds. In theory, peak musculoskeletal forces should be the same when trotting up an incline as when trotting at the same speed on the level. Assuming this is the case, we hypothesized that if peak forces determine gait transition speeds then horses should switch from a trot to a gallop at the same speed (i.e. the same critical force) regardless of incline. The aim of the present research was to examine the effects of incline on the trot–gallop transition speed in horses and to re-examine the role of metabolism in determining the trot–gallop transition. Horses (Equus caballus) were conditioned to run on a high-speed treadmill prior to data collection. Gait changes were recorded for each horse using a standardized testing protocol on the level and when trotting up a 10\% incline. Both maximum sustained trotting speeds and minimum sustained galloping speeds, representing the lower and upper limits of the trot–gallop transition, respectively,were significantly slower when trotting up an incline. After completing collection of gait transition data, the horses were trained to extend their gaits beyond the normal transition speeds, and metabolic data were collected. Maximum sustained trotting speeds were not different from the energetically optimal transition speeds, i.e. the speed at which metabolic rates are the same for both gaits.},

  abstract = {The effect on sarcomere number of immobilizing muscles in lengthened and shortened positions has been investigated in both young and adult mice. Immobilization of the soleus muscle in the shortened position resulted in a decrease in the postnatal addition of sarcomeres in young muscles and a loss of sarcomeres in adult muscles. In both there was a return to normal sarcomere numbers when the restriction was removed. Immobilization in the lengthened position resulted in a decrease in the postnatal addition of sarcomeres in very young muscles, but an increase in muscles from animals more than 24 weeks old. It is suggested that immobilization alters the functional length of the muscle, and that, whereas adult muscles can adapt to an increase or decrease in the functional length by gaining or losing sarcomeres, in young muscle the factor of overriding importance controlling sarcomere addition is the contraction of the muscle throughout its normal range of movement: if movement is restricted sarcomere production is decreased whatever the position of immobilization. The ability to recover from immobilization is not affected either by the length of the period of immobilization or by the stage in development during which recovery is made. By injecting 3H adenosine into mice recovering from immobilization, an attempt was made to label the sarcomeres which are laid down during this period of longitudinal growth. It appears that, as during normal growth, the muscle fibres were adding sarcomeres mainly at their ends. Immobilization of young muscle was found to result in a reduction of the postnatal increase in muscle fibre nuclei. Removal of the restriction was followed by a rapid increase in the number of muscle fibre nuclei. Following tenotomy of the gastrocnemius there was an increase in the number of sarcomeres in the soleus muscle fibres. It is suggested that in the absence of the gastrocnemius the soleus is not able to balance its antagonistic muscles and is thus effectively immobilized in the lengthened position, resulting in increased sarcomere production.},

Specifically, muscle masses, muscle lengths, fascicle lengths, pennation angles and muscle moment arms were measured. Maximum isometric force and power of muscles, the maximum muscle torque at joints and tendon stress and strain were estimated. We compare data with that published for a generalized breed of canid, and other cursorial mammals such as the horse and hare. The pelvic limb of the racing greyhound had a relatively large volume of hip extensor muscle, which is likely to be required for power production. Per unit body mass, some pelvic limb muscles were relatively larger than those in less specialized canines, and many hip extensor muscles had longer fascicle lengths. It was estimated that substantial extensor moments could be created about the tarsus and hip of the greyhound allowing high power output and potential for rapid acceleration. The racing greyhound hence possesses substantial specializations for enhanced sprint performance. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.},

By counting the number of muscle fibre nuclei in single teased fibres it was shown that the number of nuclei per fibre increases with age, and that this increase continues beyond the point at which the fibres have ceased to grow in length. It is suggested that post-natal increase in nuclear number is associated with both increase in length and increase in girth of the muscle fibres.By injecting tritiated adenosine into young mice, an attempt was made to label newly formed actin filaments and ribosomes and thus to determine the region where new sarcomeres are laid down during increase in fibre length. Using autoradiography and scintillation counting it was shown that the radioactive label was incorporated more into the ends than into the middle regions of the muscles. The implication of these findings is that new sarcomeres are added on serially at the ends of the muscle fibres. An investigation, at the ultrastructural level, of muscle fibres taken from foetal and newborn mice indicates that the end of the fibre is a region of active development. This area is characterized by numerous ribosome formations and by myofilaments which are not organized into myofibrils. Cells which can occasionally be seen fusing with the end regions of young muscle fibres indicate a possible way in which nuclei are added to the growing have shown that it is possible to alter both the rate and the extent of the post-natal increase in sarcomere number. Immobilization of limb joints, by means of plaster casts, so that the muscle is held in either the extended or the shortened position results in the number of sarcomeres along the fibres falling far short of that in the fibres from control muscles. Removal of the restriction is followed by a rapid increase in the number of sarcomeres in series and a return to the normal level within a period of about 4 weeks. These experiments indicate that for normal growth to occur, it is important for a muscle to be able to contract isotonically.},

  abstract = {Rugose projections on the anterior and posterior aspects of vertebral neural spines appear throughout Amniota and result from the mineralization of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments via metaplasia, the process of permanent tissue-type transformation. In mam-mals, this metaplasia is generally pathological or stress induced, but is a normal part of development in some clades of birds. Such structures, though phylogenetically sporadic, appear throughout the fossil record of non-avian theropod dinosaurs, yet their physiological and adaptive significance has remained unexamined. Here we show novel histologic and phylogenetic evidence that neural spine projections were a physiological response to bio-mechanical stress in large-bodied theropod species. Metaplastic projections also appear to vary between immature and mature individuals of the same species, with immature animals either lacking them or exhibiting smaller projections, supporting the hypothesis that these structures develop through ontogeny as a result of increasing bending stress subjected to the spinal column. Metaplastic mineralization of spinal ligaments would likely affect the flexi-bility of the spinal column, increasing passive support for body weight. A stiff spinal column would also provide biomechanical support for the primary hip flexors and, therefore, may have played a role in locomotor efficiency and mobility in large-bodied species. This new association of interspinal ligament metaplasia in Theropoda with large body size contributes additional insight to our understanding of the diverse biomechanical coping mechanisms developed throughout Dinosauria, and stresses the significance of phylogenetic methods when testing for biological trends, evolutionary or not.}

From a ``systems engineering'' perspective, this is a phenomenologically based, lumped-parameter model that is based on interpretations of input-output data obtained from controlled experiments. Simply stated, this model consists of a contractile element (CE) that is surrounded, both in series and in parallel, by ``passive'' connective tissue (Figure 5.1). CE is furthermore characterized by two fundamental relationships: CE tension-length and CE force-velocity. Each of these is modulated by an activation input that is structurally distinct from the location for mechanical coupling between the muscle and the environment (Figure 5.1).},

Palaeohistological sampling of 17 mostly extinct clades across the amniote tree revealed preservation of different intervertebral soft tissue types (cartilage, probable notochord) seen in extant reptiles. The distribution of the fossilised tissues allowed us to infer the soft part anatomy of the joint. Surprisingly, we also found evidence for an IVD in fossil reptiles, including non-avian dinosaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and marine crocodiles. Based on the fossil dataset, we traced the evolution of the amniote intervertebral joint through ancestral character state reconstruction. The IVD evolved at least twice, in mammals and in extinct diapsid reptiles. From this reptilian IVD, extant reptile groups and some non-avian dinosaurs independently evolved a synovial ball-and-socket joint. The unique birds dorsal intervertebral joint evolved from this dinosaur joint. The tuatara and some geckos reverted to the ancestral persisting notochord.},

These changes are correlated with, and enabled by, structural alterations across the molecular, subcellular, cellular, tissue, and organ scales. Despite extensive research on muscle adaptation at the individual scales, the interaction of the underlying mechanisms across the scales remains poorly understood. Here, we present a thorough review and a broad classification of multiscale muscle adaptation in response to a variety of mechanical stimuli. From this classification, we suggest that a mathematical model for skeletal muscle adaptation should include the four major stimuli, overstretch, understretch, overload, and underload, and the five key players in skeletal muscle adaptation, myosin heavy chain isoform, serial sarcomere number, parallel sarcomere number, pennation angle, and extracellular matrix composition. Including this information in multiscale computational models of muscle will shape our understanding of the interacting mechanisms of skeletal muscle adaptation across the scales. Ultimately, this will allow us to rationalize the design of exercise and rehabilitation programs, and improve the long-term success of interventional treatment in musculoskeletal disease.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Stride duration, stance duration and protraction duration are key variables when describing the gaits of terrestrial animals. Together, they determine the duty factor (the fraction of the stride for which the limb maintains contact with the ground surface), from which the peak vertical force can be estimated. When an animal changes speed, these variables change at different proportions. Limited measurements of these variables and predictions of peak limb force have been undertaken for large mammals performing high-speed over-ground exercise. This study set out to make such measurements, employing a previously validated system consisting of limb-mounted accelerometers and a Global Positioning System data logger. Measurements were made on nine elite Thoroughbred racehorses during gallop locomotion over a range of speeds from 9 to 17 m s-1. No statistically significant differences were seen in any variables between the lead and non-lead limbs for either the fore or hind pairs of limbs. Mean stance durations of 131 and 77 ms in the forelimbs and 143 and 94 ms in the hindlimbs were recorded at speeds of 9 and 17 ms-1, respectively. Equivalent values for protraction duration were 364 and 342 (fore) and 355 and 326 ms (hind). Peak limb forces (from duty factor) at 17 ms-1 were 24.7 N kg-1 body weight (range 22.6 to 26.0 N kg-1 body weight) for the forelimbs and 15.3 N kg-1 (range 13.7-16.2 N kg-1 body weight) for the hindlimbs. The duration of the aerial phase of the stride (when no limbs are in contact with the ground) was independent of speed. Overlap time (when more than one leg is on the ground) dropped with speed and approached zero at maximum speed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Size has an impact on various aspects of an animal's biology including physiology, biomechanics, and ecology. Accurately and precisely estimating size, in particular body mass, is therefore a core objective of paleobiologists. Two approaches for estimating body mass are common: whole-body volumetric models and individual element-scaling (e.g., bones, teeth). The latter has been argued to be more accurate, while the former more precise. Here, we use minimum convex hulls (MCH) to generate a predictive volumetric model for estimating body mass across a broad taxonomic and size range (127 g to 2,735 kg). We compare our MCH model to stylopodial-scaling, incorporating data from the literature, and find that MCH body mass estimation is both more accurate and more precise than stylopodial estimation. An explanation for the difference between methods is that reptile and mammal stylopod circumference and length dimensions scale differentially (slope 1.179~±~0.102 vs. 1.038~±~0.031, respectively), such that reptiles have more robust bones for a given size. Consequently, a mammalian-weighted stylopodial-scaling sample overestimates the body mass of larger reptiles and this error increases with size. We apply both estimation equations to a sample of 12 Permo-Triassic tetrapods and find that stylopodial-scaling consistently estimates a higher body mass than MCH estimation, due to even more robust bones in extinct species (slope~=~1.319~±~0.213). Finally, we take advantage of our MCH models to explore constraints regarding the position of the center of mass (CoM) and find that relative body proportions (i.e., skull: tail ratio) influence CoM position differently in mammals, crocodylians, and Permo-Triassic tetrapods. Further, we find that clade-specific body segment expansion factors do not affect group comparisons but may be important for individual specimens with rather disproportionate bodies (e.g., the small-headed and large-tailed Edaphosaurus). Our findings suggest that the whole-body volumetric approach is better suited for estimating body mass than element-scaling when anatomies are beyond the scope of the sample used to generate the scaling equations and provides added benefits such as the ability to measure inertial properties.},

  abstract = {Unloading in spaceflight or long-term bed rest induces to pronounced atrophy of anti-gravity skeletal muscles. Passive stretch partially resists unloading-induced atrophy of skeletal muscle, but the mechanism remains elusive. The aims of this study were to investigate the hypotheses that stretch tension might increase protein level of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in unloaded skeletal muscle, and then nNOS-derived NO alleviated atrophy of skeletal muscle by inhibiting calpain activity. The tail-suspended rats were used to unload rat hindlimbs for 2 weeks, at the same time, left soleus muscle was stretched by applying a plaster cast to fix the ankle at 35° dorsiflexion. Stretch partially resisted atrophy and inhibited the decreased protein level and activity of nNOS in unloaded soleus muscles. Unloading increased frequency of calcium sparks and elevated intracellular resting and caffeine-induced Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in unloaded soleus muscle fibers. Stretch reduced frequency of calcium sparks and restored intracellular resting and caffeine-induced Ca(2+) concentration to control levels in unloaded soleus muscle fibers. The increased protein level and activity of calpain as well as the higher degradation of desmin induced by unloading were inhibited by stretch in soleus muscles. In conclusion, these results suggest that stretch can preserve the stability of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channels which prevents the elevated [Ca(2+)]i by means of keeping nNOS activity, and then the enhanced protein level and activity of calpain return to control levels in unloaded soleus muscles. Therefore, stretch can resist in part atrophy of unloaded soleus muscles.},

  abstract = {Biomechanical models that compute the lengths and forces of muscle–tendon units are broadly applicable to the study of factors that promote injury and the planning and effects of orthopedic surgical procedures in equine athletes. A three‐dimensional (3D) generic musculoskeletal model of the equine forelimb comprised of bony segment, muscle–tendon, and ligament information, was developed based on high‐resolution computed tomographic (CT) and T1‐weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images from an isolated forelimb of a Thoroughbred racehorse. Image fusion was achieved through coregistration of CT and MR images with an image analysis program (Analyze™) by adjustment of the relative position and orientation of fiducial markers visible in both modalities until the mutual information between the images was maximized. 3D surfaces of the bones and origin/insertion sites, centroid paths and volumes of the muscle–tendon and ligamentous structures were obtained from the multimodal (CT/MR) images using semiautomated and manual segmentation combined with sagittal and transverse color‐cryosection anatomic images obtained from three other cadaveric equine forelimbs. Once bony and soft‐tissue structures were reconstructed in the same coordinate system, data were imported to a software package for interactive musculoskeletal modeling (SIMM               ®               ). The combination of integrated CT and MR acquisitions and anatomical images provided an accurate and efficient means of generating a 3D model of the musculoskeletal structures of an average‐sized equine adult horse.},

  abstract = {Integrins are alphabeta heterodimeric receptors that mediate attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and therefore play important roles in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival. Among the cytoskeletal proteins that interact directly with the beta-chain cytoplasmic domain, talin has emerged as playing a critical role in integrin activation and linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Talin (2541 amino acids) is an elongated (60 nm) flexible antiparallel dimer, with a small globular head connected to an extended rod. The talin head contains a FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain (residues 86-400) with binding sites for several beta integrin cytodomains and the talin rod contains a second lower-affinity integrin-binding site, a highly conserved C-terminal actin-binding site and also several binding sites for vinculin. We have determined previously the crystal structures of two domains from the talin rod, spanning residues 482-789. Talin-(482-655), which contains a VBS (vinculin-binding site), folds into a five-helix bundle whereas talin-(656-789) is a four-helix bundle. We have also reported the crystal structure of the N-terminal vinculin head domain in complex with an activated form of talin. In the present paper, we consider how binding sites buried within the folded helical bundles of talin and alpha-actinin form interactions with vinculin.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Great apes diversified during the Miocene in Old World forests. Two lineages, gorillas in Africa and orangutans in Asia, have sexual dimorphisms of super‐sized males, though they presumably diverged from a smaller common ancestor. We test the hypothesis that they increased in body mass independently and convergently, and that their many postcranial differences reflect locomotor differences. Whole body dissections of five adult male gorillas and four adult male orangutans allowed quantification of body mass distribution to limb segments, of body composition (muscle, bone, skin, and fat relative to total body mass), and of muscle distribution and proportions. Results demonstrate that gorilla forelimb anatomy accommodates shoulder joint mobility for vertical climbing and reaching while maintaining joint stability during quadrupedal locomotion. The heavily muscled hind limbs are equipped for propulsion and weight‐bearing over relatively stable substrates on the forest floor. In contrast, orangutan forelimb length, muscle mass, and joint construction are modified for strength and mobility in climbing, bridging, and traveling over flexible supports through the forest canopy. Muscles of hip, knee, and ankle joints provide rotational and prehensile strength essential for moving on unstable and discontinuous branches. We conclude that anatomical similarities are due to common ancestry and that differences in postcranial anatomy reflect powerful selection for divergent locomotor adaptations. These data further support the evolutionary conclusion that gorillas fall with chimpanzees and humans as part of the African hominoid radiation; orangutans are a specialized outlier.

  abstract = {It has been shown that stretching exercises can improve the flexibility and independence of the elderly. However, although these exercises commonly constitute training programs, the morphological adaptations induced by stretching exercises in aged skeletal muscle are still unclear. Objective: To assess the acute effects of passive mechanical static stretching on the morphology, sarcomerogenesis and modulation of important components of the extracellular matrix of the soleus muscle of aged female rats. Methods: Fifteen old female rats with 26 months were divided into two groups: stretching (n= 8, SG) and control (n= 7, CG): The stretching protocol consisted of 4 repetitions each of 1 min with 30 s interval between sets. Stretching was performed on the left soleus muscle, 3 times a week for 1 week. After three sessions, the rats were anesthetized to remove the left soleus muscle, and then euthanized. The following analyses were carried out: muscle fiber cross-sectional area and serial sarcomere number; immunohistochemistry for the quantification of collagen I, III and TGF??-1. Results: a decrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional area of the SG was observed when compared to the CG (p= 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis); the percentage of type I collagen was significantly lower in the SG when compared to the CG (p= 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis), as well as the percentage of TGF??-1 (p= 0.04, Kruskal-Wallis); collagen III was significantly higher in the SG than in the CG (7.06. ??. 6.88\% vs 4.92. ??. 5.30\%, p= 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis). Conclusion: Although the acute stretching induced muscle hypotrophy, an antifibrotic action was detected.},

  abstract = {The stem amniote               Orobates pabsti               has been reconstructed to be capable of relatively erect, balanced, and mechanically power-saving terrestrial locomotion. This suggested that the evolution of such advanced locomotor capabilities preceded the origin of crown-group amniotes. We here further investigate plausible body postures and locomotion of               Orobates               by taking soft tissues into account. Freely available animation software B               LENDER               is used to first reconstruct the lines of action of hindlimb adductors and retractors for               Orobates               and then estimate the muscle strain of these muscles. We experimentally varied different body heights in modeled hindlimb stride cycles of               Orobates               to find the posture that maximizes optimal strains over the course of a stride cycle. To validate our method, we used               Caiman crocodilus               . We replicated the identical workflow used for the analysis of               Orobates               and compared the locomotor posture predicted for               Caiman               based on muscle strain analysis with this species’ actual postural data known from a previously published X-ray motion analysis. Since this validation experiment demonstrated a close match between the modeled posture that maximizes optimal adductor and retractor muscle strain and the               in vivo               posture employed by               Caiman               , using the same method for               Orobates               was justified. Generally, the use of muscle strain analysis for the reconstruction of posture in quadrupedal vertebrate fossils thus appears a promising approach. Nevertheless, results for               Orobates               remained inconclusive as several postures resulted in similar muscle strains and none of the postures could be entirely excluded. These results are not in conflict with the previously inferred moderately erect locomotor posture of               Orobates               and suggest considerable variability of posture during locomotion.},
