Unless stated otherwise, all the python scripts in this folder (and subfolders) are intended to be opened and run in Blender's [text editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/text_editor.html).

The Matlab scripts will require installing the [OpenSim API](https://opensimconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenSim/pages/53089380/Scripting+with+Matlab)
